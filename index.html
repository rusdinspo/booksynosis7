<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Wall</h2><p>[*Translated by Shaun Whiteside]<br><br> The 2012 adaptation of this classic dystopian novel is directed by Julian Roman Polsler and stars internationally renowned actress Martina Gedeck.<br><br> <i>''I can allow myself to write the truth; all the people for whom I have lied throughout my life are dead . . .''</i> writes the heroine of Marlen Haushofer's <i>The Wall</i>, a quite ordinary, unnamed middle-aged woman who awakens to find she is the last living human being. Surmising her solitude is the result of a military experiment gone awry, she begins the terrifying work of not only survival but also self-renewal. <i>The Wall</i> is at once a simple and moving journal--with talk of potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one's name -- and a disturbing meditation on twentieth-century history.</p><p>I can allow myself to write the truth; all the people for whom I have lied throughout my life are dead...&#x201d; writes the heroine of Marlen Haushofer&#x2019;s <i>The Wall</i>, a quite ordinary, unnamed middle-aged woman who awakens to find she is the last living person. Accompanied by her dog, she begins the terrifying work of survival, and eventually, self-renewal. <i>The Wall</i> is at once a simple and moving chronicle&#x2014;of growing potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one&#x2019;s name and a disturbing meditation on 20th-century history. Now a major motion picture from Music Box Films, <i>The Wall</i> is a haunting study of what a person can love when everything has been taken away.MARLEN HAUSHOFER (1920-1970) was born in Frauenstein, a region in Upper Austria. She attended Catholic boarding school in Linz and studied German literature in Vienna and Graz. Her adult life was spent in Steyr, an old industrial city with a strong working class culture and a history of militancy. She published the novella <i>The Fifth Year</i> in 1952 and earned her first literary award in 1953. Her first novel, <i>A Handful of Life</i>, was published in 1955. <i>The Wall</i>, published in 1962, is considered her greatest literary achievement. Variously interpreted as an ironic Robinson Crusoe story, a philosophical parable of human isolation, and as dystopian fiction, <i>The Wall</i> is currently recognized for its important place in traditions of feminist fiction. Haushofers's last novel, <i>The Attic</i>, was published in 1969. Her last short story collection, <i>Terrible Faithfulness</i>, earned her the Austrian state prize for literature. She has been translated into several European languages, but <i>The Wall</i> is her only work available in English.</p><h2>From Dream To Destiny</h2><p>If you have a dream, then you have a destiny. In his inspiring new book, From Dream to Destiny, Robert Morris prompts you to ask, How do I travel from the dream to the destiny&#x2014;and what happens on the way? Each of us is given a dream by God&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the notion that sets our hearts racing by the mere thought of it. Unfortunately, most people never see their dream come to pass, so they never fulfill the destiny that God has in store. Robert Morris tells readers exactly how to make their dream into the reality they long for. He uses the example of Joseph&#x2019;s life in the Old Testament. God gave Joseph a dream and then promptly took him through 10 character-building tests that lasted 13 years. These tests assessed Joseph&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses&#x2014;from pride to purity&#x2014;and they are the same tests that each of us must pass before God lets us realize our dream. Find out what the tests are, if you are passing or failing them, and get ready to begin fulfilling the destiny that you have long dreamed of.</p><p>If you have a dream, then you have a destiny.

Her father had taught her how to use the tools with which she dug into the sand and scraped at the stones that fell from the cliffs. And he had taught her how to look, to look hard, for "curiosities."<br><br>One day, when she was eleven, Mary Anning spotted some markings on a wide, flat stone. She chipped at it with her hammer and chisel until the lines of a tooth emerged--and then those of another tooth. Weeks of persistent effort yielded a face about four feet long. But what creature was this? Her brother called it a sea dragon.<br><br>Many months later, Mary Anning still had not unearthed what she only then learned was called a fossil. But she found out that her discovery was precious and that the painstaking effort to uncover traces of ancient life was profoundly important. Jeannine Atkins's sensitive and engaging portrait is strikingly illustrated by Michael Dooling, whose powerful paintings capture young Mary Anning's devotion to her work, and all the joy she found in it.<br></p><p><b>Jeannine Atkins,</b> a former high school English teacher, is the author of three other picture books, including <i>A Name on the Quilt</i>, illustrated by Tad Hills. Intrigued by the mix of legends and facts surrounding Mary Anning, the author visited Lyme Regis, and there conceived her interpretation of the events leading to Mary Anning's lifelong search for fossils. Jeannine Atkins lives with her family in Whately, Massachesetts.<br><br><b>Michael Dooling</b> has illustrated numerous books for children. Among them are <i>George Washington: A Picture Book Biography</i> by James Cross Giblin and O. Henry's <i>The Gift of the Magi and Other Stories</i>. He lives in Audubon, New Jersey, with his wife, Jane, and her daughters, Rachel and Lisa. <br>Grade 2-4-Two more picture-book biographies celebrate Mary Anning's bicentennial, recounting her childhood discovery of a complete ichthyosaur and noting her adult career as a self-taught paleontologist. Atkins follows the earlier lead of Catherine Brighton in The Fossil Girl (Millbrook, 1999) and Laurence Anholt in Stone Girl, Bone Girl (Orchard, 1999) as she focuses on the single year in which 11-year-old Anning slowly scraped the sand and stone of the Lyme Regis shore to uncover the huge reptile fossil. Her patience and persistence, are emphasized in a smoothly crafted narrative employing more fictionalized conversation and detail than any of the other books. Dooling's watercolors on textured paper employ a predominantly blue, gray, and brown palette conveying the loneliness of Anning's pursuit in this murky, seaside place. Like Brighton and Anholt, Atkins adds a final author's note commenting on Mary Anning's adult discoveries. Don Brown, in a smaller horizontal volume, omits such a note. His text quickly recounts Anning's childhood discovery of the ichthyosaur, and goes on to sketch a chronological account of the woman's entire life. The tan-and-blue watercolor scenes are less compelling than the bolder work in the other books, though several dramatic episodes punctuate the dangerous terrain in which Anning worked. The emphasis here is on the richness of spirit compensating for economic poverty. Both Stone Girl and Fossil Girl are more strongly realized and appealing works, but Sea Dragon reads well, and Rare Treasure is a competent simple biography. None of the writers reveal their actual sources of information on Anning's life. The tale of a child making such a distinctive discovery is inherently interesting, and the scientist's career is a worthwhile story, too. The array of books should attract a wide variety of readers and serve well in science classrooms.<br><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Hurricane Sisters: A Novel</h2><p><p>Hurricane season begins early and rumbles all summer long, well into September.

Through the slats on the window shades, the first murky hint of dawn slipped, slanting shadowy bars over the bed. It was like waking in a cell.</p><p>For a moment she simply lay there, shuddering, imprisoned, while the dream faded. After ten years on the force, Eve still had dreams.</p><p>Six hours before, she&#x2019;d killed a man, had watched death creep into his eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time she&#x2019;d exercised maximum force, or dreamed. She&#x2019;d learned to accept the action and the consequences.</p><p>But it was the child that haunted her. The child she hadn&#x2019;t been in time to save. The child whose screams had echoed in the dreams with her own.</p><p>All the blood, Eve thought, scrubbing sweat from her face with her hands. Such a small little girl to have had so much blood in her. And she knew it was vital that she push it aside.</p><p>Standard departmental procedure meant that she would spend the morning in Testing. Any officer whose discharge of weapon resulted in termination of life was required to undergo emotional and psychiatric clearance before resuming duty. Eve considered the tests a mild pain in the ass.</p><p>She would beat them, as she&#x2019;d beaten them before.</p><p>When she rose, the overheads went automatically to low setting, lighting her way into the bath. She winced once at her reflection. Her eyes were swollen from lack of sleep, her skin nearly as pale as the corpses she&#x2019;d delegated to the ME.</p><p>Rather than dwell on it, she stepped into the shower, yawning.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me one oh one degrees, full force,&#x201d; she said and shifted so that the shower spray hit her straight in the face.</p><p>She let it steam, lathered listlessly while she played through the events of the night before. She wasn&#x2019;t due in Testing until nine, and would use the next three hours to settle and let the dream fade away completely.</p><p>Small doubts and little regrets were often detected and could mean a second and more intense round with the machines and the owl-eyed technicians who ran them.</p><p>Eve didn&#x2019;t intend to be off the streets longer than twenty-four hours.</p><p>After pulling on a robe, she walked into the kitchen and programmed her AutoChef for coffee, black; toast, light. Through her window she could hear the heavy hum of air traffic carrying early commuters to offices, late ones home. She&#x2019;d chosen the apartment years before because it was in a heavy ground and air pattern, and she liked the noise and crowds. On another yawn, she glanced out the window, followed the rattling journey of an aging airbus hauling laborers not fortunate enough to work in the city or by home-links.</p><p>She brought the <i>New York Times</i> up on her monitor and scanned the headlines while the faux caffeine bolstered her system. The AutoChef had burned her toast again, but she ate it anyway, with a vague thought of springing for a replacement unit.</p><p>She was frowning over an article on a mass recall of droid cocker spaniels when her tele-link blipped. Eve shifted to communications and watched her commanding officer flash onto the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d; He gave her a brisk nod, noted the still wet hair and sleepy eyes. &#x201c;Incident at Twenty-seven West Broadway, eighteenth floor. You&#x2019;re primary.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve lifted a brow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on Testing. Subject terminated at twenty-two thirty-five.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have override,&#x201d; he said, without inflection. &#x201c;Pick up your shield and weapon on the way to the incident. Code Five, lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; His face flashed off even as she pushed back from the screen. Code Five meant she would report directly to her commander, and there would be no unsealed interdepartmental reports and no cooperation with the press.</p><p>In essence, it meant she was on her own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Broadway was noisy and crowded, a party where rowdy guests never left. Street, pedestrian, and sky traffic were miserable, choking the air with bodies and vehicles. In her old days in uniform she remembered it as a hot spot for wrecks and crushed tourists who were too busy gaping at the show to get out of the way.</p><p>Even at this hour there was steam rising from the stationary and portable food stands that offered everything from rice noodles to soydogs for the teeming crowds. She had to swerve to avoid an eager merchant on his smoking Glida-Grill, and took his flipped middle finger as a matter of course.</p><p>Eve double-parked and, skirting a man who smelled worse than his bottle of brew, stepped onto the sidewalk. She scanned the building first, fifty floors of gleaming metal that knifed into the sky from a hilt of concrete. She was propositioned twice before she reached the door.</p><p>Since this five-block area of Broadway was affectionately termed Prostitute&#x2019;s Walk, she wasn&#x2019;t surprised. She flashed her badge for the uniform guarding the entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He skimmed his official compu-seal over the door to keep out the curious, then led the way to the bank of elevators. &#x201c;Eighteenth floor,&#x201d; he said when the doors swished shut behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill me in, officer.&#x201d; Eve switched on her recorder and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t first on the scene, lieutenant. Whatever happened upstairs is being kept upstairs. There&#x2019;s a badge inside waiting for you. We have a Homicide, and a Code Five in number Eighteen-oh-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who called it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have that information.&#x201d;</p><p>He stayed where he was when the elevator opened. Eve stepped out and was alone in a narrow hallway. Security cameras tilted down at her and her feet were almost soundless on the worn nap of the carpet as she approached 1803. Ignoring the handplate, she announced herself, holding her badge up to eye level for the peep cam until the door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feeney.&#x201d; She smiled, pleased to see a familiar face. Ryan Feeney was an old friend and former partner who&#x2019;d traded the street for a desk and a top level position in the Electronics Detection Division. &#x201c;So, they&#x2019;re sending computer pluckers these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wanted brass, and the best.&#x201d; His lips curved in his wide, rumpled face, but his eyes remained sober. He was a small, stubby man with small, stubby hands and rust colored hair. &#x201c;You look beat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rough night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; He offered her one of the sugared nuts from the bag he habitually carried, studying her, and measuring if she was up to what was waiting in the bedroom beyond.</p><p>She was young for her rank, barely thirty, with wide brown eyes that had never had a chance to be naive. Her doe-brown hair was cropped short, for convenience rather than style, but suited her triangular face with its razor-edge cheekbones and slight dent in the chin.</p><p>She was tall, rangy, with a tendency to look thin, but Feeney knew there were solid muscles beneath the leather jacket. More, there was a brain, and a heart.</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s going to be touchy, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I picked that up already. Who&#x2019;s the victim?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharon DeBlass, granddaughter of Senator DeBlass.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither meant anything to her. &#x201c;Politics isn&#x2019;t my forte, Feeney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The gentleman from Virginia, extreme right, old money. The granddaughter took a sharp left a few years back, moved to New York, and became a licensed companion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was a hooker.&#x201d; Dallas glanced around the apartment. It was furnished in obsessive modern&#x2014;glass and thin chrome, signed holograms on the walls, recessed bar in bold red. The wide mood screen behind the bar bled with mixing and merging shapes and colors in cool pastels.</p><p>Neat as a virgin, Eve mused, and cold as a whore. &#x201c;No surprise, given her choice of real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Politics makes it delicate. Victim was twenty-four, Caucasian female. She bought it in bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve only lifted a brow. &#x201c;Seems poetic, since she&#x2019;d been bought there. How&#x2019;d she die?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the next problem. I want you to see for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>As they crossed the room, each took out a slim container, sprayed their hands front and back to seal in oils and fingerprints. At the doorway, Eve sprayed the bottom of her boots to slicken them so that she would pick up no fibers, stray hairs, or skin.</p><p>Eve was already wary. Under normal circumstances there would have been two other investigators on a homicide scene, with recorders for sound and pictures. Forensics would have been waiting with their usual snarly impatience to sweep the scene.</p><p>The fact that only Feeney had been assigned with her meant that there were a lot of eggshells to be walked over.</p><p>&#x201c;Security cameras in the lobby, elevator, and hallways,&#x201d; Eve commented.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already tagged the discs.&#x201d; Feeney opened the bedroom door and let her enter first.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Death rarely was a peaceful, religious experience to Eve&#x2019;s mind. It was the nasty end, indifferent to saint and sinner. But this was shocking, like a stage deliberately set to offend.</p><p>The bed was huge, slicked with what appeared to be genuine satin sheets the color of ripe peaches. Small, soft focused spotlights were trained on its center where the naked woman was cupped in the gentle dip of the floating mattress.</p><p>The mattress moved with obscenely graceful undulations to the rhythm of programmed music slipping through the headboard.</p><p>She was beautiful still, a cameo face with a tumbling waterfall of flaming red hair, emerald eyes that stared glassily at the mirrored ceiling, long, milk white limbs that called to mind visions of <i>Swan Lake</i> as the motion of the bed gently rocked them.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t artistically arranged now, but spread lewdly so that the dead woman formed a final X dead center of the bed.</p><p>There was a hole in her forehead, one in her chest, another horribly gaping between the open thighs. Blood had splattered on the glossy sheets, pooled, dripped, and stained.</p><p>There were splashes of it on the lacquered walls, like lethal paintings scrawled by an evil child.</p><p>So much blood was a rare thing, and she had seen much too much of it the night before to take the scene as calmly as she would have preferred.</p><p>She had to swallow once, hard, and force herself to block out the image of a small child.</p><p>&#x201c;You got the scene on record?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then turn that damn thing off.&#x201d; She let out a breath after Feeney located the controls that silenced the music. The bed flowed to stillness. &#x201c;The wounds,&#x201d; Eve murmured, stepping closer to examine them. &#x201c;Too neat for a knife. Too messy for a laser.&#x201d; A flash came to her&#x2014;old training films, old videos, old viciousness.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, Feeney, these look like bullet wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeney reached into his pocket and drew out a sealed bag. &#x201c;Whoever did it left a souvenir.&#x201d; He passed the bag to Eve. &#x201c;An antique like this has to go for eight, ten thousand for a legal collection, twice that on the black market.&#x201d;</p><p>Fascinated, Eve turned the sealed revolver over in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heavy,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Bulky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-eight caliber,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;First one I&#x2019;ve seen outside of a museum. This one&#x2019;s a Smith &amp; Wesson, Model Ten, blue steel.&#x201d; He looked at it with some affection. &#x201c;Real classic piece, used to be standard police issue up until the latter part of the twentieth. They stopped making them in about twenty-two, twenty-three, when the gun ban was passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the history buff.&#x201d; Which explained why he was with her. &#x201c;Looks new.&#x201d; She sniffed through the bag, caught the scent of oil and burning. &#x201c;Somebody took good care of this. Steel fired into flesh,&#x201d; she mused as she passed the bag back to Feeney. &#x201c;Ugly way to die, and the first I&#x2019;ve seen it in my ten years with the department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Second for me. About fifteen years ago, Lower East Side, party got out of hand. Guy shot five people with a twenty-two before he realized it wasn&#x2019;t a toy. Hell of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fun and games,&#x201d; Eve murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll scan the collectors, see how many we can locate who own one like this. Somebody might have reported a robbery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely it came through the black market.&#x201d; Eve glanced back at the body. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s been in the business for a few years, she&#x2019;d have discs, records of her clients, her trick books.&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;With Code Five, I&#x2019;ll have to do the door-to-door myself. Not a simple sex crime,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Whoever did it set it up. The antique weapon, the wounds themselves, almost ruler straight down the body, the lights, the pose. Who called it in, Feeney?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The killer.&#x201d; He waited until her eyes came back to him. &#x201c;From right here. Called the station. See how the bedside unit&#x2019;s aimed at her face? That&#x2019;s what came in. Video, no audio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s into showmanship.&#x201d; Eve let out a breath. &#x201c;Clever bastard, arrogant, cocky. He had sex with her first. I&#x2019;d bet my badge on it. Then he gets up and does it.&#x201d; She lifted her arm, aiming, lowering it as she counted off, &#x201c;One, two, three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; murmured Feeney.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cold. He smooths down the sheets after. See how neat they are? He arranges her, spreads her open so nobody can have any doubts as to how she made her living. He does it carefully, practically measuring, so that she&#x2019;s perfectly aligned. Center of the bed, arms and legs equally apart. Doesn&#x2019;t turn off the bed &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s part of the show. He leaves the gun because he wants us to know right away he&#x2019;s no ordinary man. He&#x2019;s got an ego. He doesn&#x2019;t want to waste time letting the body be discovered eventually. He wants it now. That instant gratification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was licensed for men and women,&#x201d; Feeney pointed out, but Eve shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a woman. A woman wouldn&#x2019;t have left her looking both beautiful and obscene. No, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a woman. Let&#x2019;s see what we can find. Have you gone into her computer yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s your case, Dallas. I&#x2019;m only authorized to assist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See if you can access her client files.&#x201d; Eve went to the dresser and began to carefully search drawers.</p><p>Expensive taste, Eve reflected. There were several items of real silk, the kind no simulation could match. The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.</p><p>The contents of the drawers were meticulously ordered, lingerie folded precisely, sweaters arranged according to color and material. The closet was the same.</p><p>Obviously the victim had a love affair with clothes and a taste for the best and took scrupulous care of what she owned.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d died naked.</p><p>&#x201c;Kept good records,&#x201d; Feeney called out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all here. Her client list, appointments&#x2014;including her required monthly health exam and her weekly trip to the beauty salon. She used the Trident Clinic for the first and Paradise for the second.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Both top of the line. I&#x2019;ve got a friend who saved for a year so she could have one day for the works at Paradise. Takes all kinds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s sister went for it for her twenty-fifth anniversary. Cost damn near as much as my kid&#x2019;s wedding. Hello, we&#x2019;ve got her personal address book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Copy all of it, will you, Feeney?&#x201d; At his low whistle, she looked over her shoulder, glimpsed the small gold-...</p></p><h2>The First Book of Football</h2><p>A former coach provides children with information on all aspects of football, including necessary skills, the traits it takes to be a great player, and the strategies required to form a winning team</p><p>Grade 5 Up Madden writes the way he talks: short sentences, lots of movement, lots of football terms, and lots of enthusiasm. In this book he gives readers a brief introduction to the sport, speaking to those who may only want to watch as well as those who want to play (or just carry the water bucket). In keeping with his belief in learning by doing, Madden keeps actual instructions of how to do things very brief. Diagrams are used to help explain some of the strategies and plays described, such as showing the differences among fly, post, corner, and curl patterns. Brief anecdotes from Madden's professional career add color to the presentation. A nice selection of well-captioned photographs is included as well. Namath's Football for Young Players and Parents (S. &amp; S., 1987) or Dolan's Basic Football Strategy (Doubleday, 1976; o.p.) will provide more specifics of play for those who want to learn how to do it. Madden provides inspiration for youngsters who already are familiar with twith the basics.

But to really understand it, you&#x2019;d have to go way back in time, and peek through the living room window of a girl named Winifred Malladi-Maraj, on her last day of fourth grade. Since time travel isn&#x2019;t possible, you&#x2019;ll just have to picture things. So picture this:<br><br>After walking home from school, Winnie stepped through the front door, with her backpack over her shoulder. Winnie&#x2019;s parents were sitting on the living room couch, with their hands in their laps. They were watching the front door, like they&#x2019;d been waiting for their daughter for a long time.<br><br>Winnie pulled off her backpack and dropped it in the doorway. Buttons, who is the world&#x2019;s greatest cat, wove his way between Winnie&#x2019;s legs, like he knew she was about to need snuggling. &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; Winnie said, squinting her eyes at her parents on the couch. &#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; She could tell right away that something weird was going on.<br><br>It&#x2019;s probably important to know that Winnie&#x2019;s parents have never been exactly normal. Like, instead of playing board games after dinner, the way some families did, Winnie&#x2019;s dad&#x2014;a biologist&#x2014;might sit her down for a slide show about his latest research on the beneficial properties of bat guano, which only made Winnie wish she&#x2019;d never eaten dinner at all. Or Winnie&#x2019;s mom&#x2014;a mathematician&#x2014;might try to explain her current work on the Conway&#x2019;s thrackle conjecture, which only made Winnie wish she&#x2019;d never grown ears.<br><br>(Once, Winnie made the mistake of asking if she and her parents could play Boggle after dinner, and afterward she&#x2019;d had to sit through a two-hour presentation of all of her parents&#x2019; many awards and grants&#x2014;none of which, they informed Winnie, had been won playing Boggle&#x2014;and a four-hour argument about whether or not Winnie&#x2019;s dad had more awards than Winnie&#x2019;s mom because there were simply more prizes for biologists than there were for mathematicians.)<br><br>(Winnie never asked about Boggle again.)<br><br>But finding her parents waiting for her on the couch together seemed especially weird to Winnie. Because, normally, Winnie&#x2019;s parents weren&#x2019;t even home when she got out of school. Normally, Winnie started her homework all by herself and then heated water on the stove exactly at 5:55 p.m., so the pot would be boiling and ready to put pasta in as soon as they got home. (Winnie&#x2019;s parents were very precise about mealtimes.)<br><br>(They were very precise about a lot of stuff.)<br><br>Another weird thing Winnie noticed that afternoon was the way her parents were sitting. While she was standing in the doorway with Buttons weaving between her legs, she realized that she hadn&#x2019;t ever seen both of her parents on the same couch before. When they watched television or sat with guests, Winnie&#x2019;s mom usually squished herself against one couch arm, while her dad sat in the recliner on the far side of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Winnie asked. Even Buttons let out a confused <i>mew?</i><br><br>&#x201c;Come sit down,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom replied, patting the couch cushion between herself and Winnie&#x2019;s dad.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad agreed. (That was another weird thing, Winnie noticed. Her parents <i>never</i> agreed.) &#x201c;Have a seat. We marked a spot for you.&#x201d;<br><br>And that was the weirdest thing of all. There was a tiny X of masking tape stuck to the center of the middle couch cushion. Her parents, Winnie realized as she stepped closer, had measured out a spot for her, so that she&#x2019;d be sitting exactly evenly between them&#x2014;not one millimeter closer to one than the other.<br><br>But Winnie, who was pretty used to her parents being weird, decided there was nothing to do but sit. Buttons sat, too, hopping right into her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Winifred,&#x201d; her mom said. She cleared her throat. &#x201c;Your father and I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad cut in, putting up a hand to stop Winnie&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;We agreed I would tell her. You got to tell Winifred about the tooth fairy.&#x201d;<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s mom frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how that&#x2019;s pertinent, Varun. This is an entirely different&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We discussed this,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad argued. &#x201c;But once again, you&#x2019;re attempting to ruin&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>While Winnie&#x2019;s parents argued, Buttons purred a little louder in Winnie&#x2019;s lap, scrunching his head under her hand. Winnie scratched and scratched at Buttons&#x2019;s soft orange fur, while her parents argued and argued. Winnie watched her mom, so angry with her dad. She watched her dad, so furious with her mom. Her parents might have been acting weird, Winnie realized, but the fighting, that was completely normal.<br><br>And when she realized that, Winnie knew, deep in her gut, precisely why her parents had sat her down on that tiny X of masking tape.<br><br>&#x201c;You guys are getting a divorce, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; she asked them.<br><br>Her parents stopped fighting at once. They turned, both together, and they stared at her.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing you were going to tell me, right?&#x201d; Winnie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom said, putting a hand on Winnie&#x2019;s knee. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t worry. We have a very sensible plan for how to divide your time equally between the two of us.&#x201d;<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s dad put a hand on Winnie&#x2019;s other knee. &#x201c;Exactly evenly,&#x201d; he told her.<br><br>For the next half an hour, Winnie sat precisely between her two parents, with one of their hands on each of her knees, as they explained their very sensible plan for her future.<br><br>They&#x2019;d found an unusual street, they told Winnie, a &#x201c;real gold mine,&#x201d; called Circle Road, just one block over from Winnie&#x2019;s uncle Huck&#x2019;s house.<br><br>Winnie scratched a little harder at Buttons&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>Circle Road, Winnie&#x2019;s parents explained, looped around on itself in a tiny circle, so that there was just enough space for two houses.<br><br>Winnie stroked Buttons&#x2019;s soft belly.<br><br>Winnie&#x2019;s mom would live in the two-story Colonial on the northernmost end of the circle, and Winnie would stay with her on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.<br><br>Winnie caressed the base of Buttons&#x2019;s ears, just the way he liked.<br><br>Her dad would live on the southernmost side of the street, in the yellow split-level (which might have <i>seemed </i>smaller than Winnie&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s house, he informed his daughter, but was technically bigger, because of the square footage of the basement). Winnie would stay with him on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.<br><br>Winnie rubbed under Buttons&#x2019;s orange chin.<br><br>Both houses had sprawling backyards, they went on, which backed up onto each other.<br><br>Winnie nestled her cheek in the soft fur at the base of Buttons&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>And at the exact center of Circle Road, her parents said, smack in between the two houses&#x2014;and definitely <i>not </i>(they&#x2019;d checked) on either parent&#x2019;s property&#x2014;was an enormous linden tree, with thick branches that reached in all directions. That&#x2019;s where Winnie would stay on Wednesdays.<br><br>Winnie must&#x2019;ve squeezed Buttons a little too tightly then, because he let out an angry <i>mew!</i><br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to live in a <i>tree</i>?&#x201d; Winnie asked her parents. It was the first thing she&#x2019;d said in thirty minutes.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous,&#x201d; her mom said.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be in a <i>treehouse</i>,&#x201d; her dad clarified. &#x201c;Your uncle Huck has already agreed to design it.&#x201d;<br><br>Hearing that made Winnie and Buttons feel a little bit better, because Uncle Huck was both an amazing uncle and a fabulous architect. (He was also the one who&#x2019;d taught Winnie all about Artist Vision, which was something that would definitely come in handy later.) But still . . .<br><br>&#x201c;You really want me to live in a treehouse <i>every Wednesday</i>?&#x201d; Winnie asked, glancing from her mom to her dad and back again. &#x201c;All by myself?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only way to split things evenly,&#x201d; her dad replied. &#x201c;Since every week has seven days in it. Seven, you know, is not an even number.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom said. &#x201c;We went over and over it. That&#x2019;s the only way it works. Three days with your father, three days with me, and one day on your own. Doesn&#x2019;t that sound like a very sensible plan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um . . . ,&#x201d; Winnie began, glancing from her dad to her mom and back again. Buttons wasn&#x2019;t quite sure how he felt about things, either. &#x201c;I guess?&#x201d; she said at last.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew you&#x2019;d think so,&#x201d; her dad said with a smile. &#x201c;It was my idea, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Your </i>idea?&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s mom cried. &#x201c;I very much disagree with <i>that </i>statement, Varun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, do you?&#x201d; Winnie&#x2019;s dad said. &#x201c;What a shock, Alexis, that you feel the need to disagree with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll disagree with you when you take claim to <i>my </i>proposals, Varun.&#x201d;<br><br>As her parents continued their argument, Winnie scooped up Buttons and headed down the hallway to her room. Neither of her parents seemed to notice that she&#x2019;d left. Winnie shut the door on their bickering, thinking that perhaps it wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad after all, having one day a week to herself.</p><h2>Lost goddesses of early Greece: A collection of pre-Hellenic myths</h2><p>For thousands of years before the classical myths were recorded by Hesiod and Homer, the Goddess was the focus of religion and culture. In <i>Lost Goddesses of Early Greece</i>, Charlene Spretnak recreates, the original, goddess-centered myths and illuminates the contemporary emergence of a spirituality based on our embeddedness in nature.</p><p>Charlene Spretnak is the author of several books that proposed a &#34;map of the terrain&#34; and an engagement with various emergent social movements, intellectual orientations, and largely unexplored subjects. She has helped to create an eco-social frame of reference and vision in the areas of social criticism, cultural history, philosophy, and religion and spirituality. Since the mid-1980s, all of her books have been an engagement with modernity, its discontents, and the corrective efforts that are arising. She is a co-founder of the Green Party movement in the United States and is a professor of philosophy and religion at the California Institute of Integral Studies, a graduate institute in San Francisco. In 2006 Charlene Spretnak was named by the British government&#39;s Environment Department as one of the &#34;100 Eco-Heroes of All Time.&#34;"Spretnak's treatment of the myths is most impressive." --Walter Burkert, author of <i>Greek Religion</i><br><br>"Charlene Spretnak has succeeded extremely well in presenting pure characterizations of the Old European goddesses as they were revered for millennia, long before the Indo-European elements were imposed to create Olympian mythology." --Marija Gimbutas, author of <i>The Language of the Goddess<br><br></i>"A truly beautiful book. With it Charlene Spretnak has raised new and important questions about the power of myth." --Merlin Stone, author of <i>Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood</i><br><br>"The book is essential...both academically accurate and a personal medium of passage." --<i>CoEvolution Quarterly</i><br><br>"Charlene Spretnak rediscovers the goddesses' early significance and in fascinating portraits restores them to their original glory." --<i>Publishers Weekly<br></i><br>"A basic text of the goddess movement that has spread through feminist and ecological circles for a decade." --<i>Boston Globe<br><br></i>"A poetic revelation of pre-Hellenic mythology." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of the Late Keith Moon</h2><p>Covers the last ten years of the life of Keith Moon, drummer for The Who, widely acknowledged as the best drummer in rock and famous for his lunacy</p><p>Peter 'Dougal' Butler grew up in the same 1960s London milieu as the founding members (Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle, Keith Moon) of the band that became The Who. Leaving school aged 15, Butler was first employed by HM Customs &amp; Excise, but after finding his way into The Who's inner circle he became personal assistant, chauffeur, bodyguard, and minder to the band's drummer, Keith Moon. Butler carried out these functions for a tumultuous ten years, following Moon to live in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, but leaving the Who's employ in the year prior to Moon's untimely death by overdose in September 1978. In the years immediately thereafter Butler worked with film and TV writers (and long-time collaborators) Peter Lawrence and Chris Trengove to produce Full Moon, a widely admired memoir of his experiences with Moon.</p><h2>Richard Avedon Portraits</h2><p>A selection of works by the influential portrait photographer, packaged in an accordion-folding folio, spans his entire career and demonstrates his signature technique of portraying his subject without extraneous detail and against white backgrounds.</p><p>Richard Avedon is one of the most influential photographers of the second half of the 20th century. His portrait work comprises an authoritative record of our era. His many books have set a standard for photographic publishing. As a staff photographer for Harper&#39;s Bazaar and later for Vogue, Avedon redefined what a fashion photograph is. In 1992 he was named the first staff photographer in the history of The New Yorker.The subject of an upcoming retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Avedon long ago entered the canon of fashion photography and modern portraiture. His trademark images of people standing against white backdrops, at once unflinching and glamorous in their effect, have helped define our idea of celebrity itself (if Avedon shot them, they must be famous). This slipcased, accordion-fold collection of 50 black and white portraits from the past 50 years, produced for the exhibition and including an essay by curator Maria Morris Hambourg and Met research assistant Mia Fineman, as well as a brief word from the photographer himself, will do little to change Avedon's reputation. It offers, in essence, a greatest hits collection of well-known faces---Andy Warhol, William Burroughs, and that pale, hairless beekeeper covered in bugs. For those unfamiliar with Avedon's work, or for true completists, the classy package of tri-tone reproductions will prove enticing.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Remarkable Life of William Beebe: Explorer And Naturalist</h2><p>When William Beebe needed to know what was going on in the depths of the ocean, he had himself lowered a half-mile down in a four-foot steel sphere to see-five times deeper than anyone had ever gone in the 1930s. When he wanted to trace the evolution of pheasants in 1910, he trekked on foot through the mountains and jungles of the Far East to locate every species. To decipher the complex ecology of the tropics, he studied the interactions of every creature and plant in a small area from the top down, setting the emerging field of tropical ecology into dynamic motion.<br> William Beebe's curiosity about the natural world was insatiable, and he did nothing by halves. As the first biographer to see the letters and private journals Beebe kept from 1887 until his death in 1962, science writer Carol Grant Gould brings the life and times of this groundbreaking scientist and explorer compellingly to light.<br> From the Galapagos Islands to the jungles of British Guiana, from the Bronx Zoo to the deep seas, Beebe's biography is a riveting adventure. A best-selling author in his own time, Beebe was a fearless explorer and thoughtful scientist who put his life on the line in pursuit of knowledge. The unique glimpses he provided into the complex web of interactions that keeps the earth alive and breathing have inspired generations of conservationists and ecologists. This exciting biography of a great naturalist brings William Beebe at last to the recognition he deserves.<br></p><p>Carol Grant Gould he has written The Animal Mind, Sexual Selection, and The Honey Bee, all considered classic books on animal behavior for lay audiences. They live in Princeton, New Jersey.One had to be brave indeed in 1930 to climb into a steel capsule and descend 2,000 feet below the surface of the ocean. That was much deeper than any living person had ever gone before, and William Beebe knew that the enormous pressure down there could crush him in an instant. Sure enough, the craft began to leak, and as it spun on the end of its tether, Beebe's companion became violently seasick.<p> Beebe was a brilliant writer, but this environment was so alien that words failed him; his pen and pad lay still. He did manage to record some of the grotesque, glowing creatures that swam in and out of his field of view, and some of them haven't been observed since. All he could do was marvel at the blueness of it all, "an indefinable translucent blue quite unlike anything I have ever seen in the upper world."</p><p> In his day (he was born in Brooklyn in 1877), William Beebe was quite famous as an explorer and naturalist. He was a bold character who feared nothing in nature: no bite, no sting, no slimy, wiggly beast. He was the kind of guy who, even as he tumbled toward the edge of a cliff, could look up at the clouds and be reminded of the pheasants that obsessed him.</p><p> In Guyana, he slept with his toes exposed in order to attract -- and study -- vampire bats. This was clearly a man at ease with his place in the food chain. "Never in city, house or room have I ever felt such a feeling of comfortable and complete habitation," he wrote in a wonderful 1921 book called Edge of the Jungle. "It seemed as if I was returning -- not venturing."</p><p> The aristocratically lean Beebe had a knack for charming wealthy socialites as well as creatures of the jungle. As a consequence, he never lacked funding for his ambitious expeditions. (He did once make the mistake of trying to run an expedition from his patron's yacht, which turned disastrous when the man proved to be an angry drunk.) He was a friend and prot�g� of Theodore Roosevelt, among others, and he moved easily between the laboratory and the cocktail party, the tropics and Manhattan. His life seemed a series of enviably romantic adventures to South American jungles, to the Himalayas, to the Galapagos and everywhere else his curiosity took him. One wealthy patron paid for him to travel all over Asia, researching his monumental Monograph of the Pheasants.</p><p> "William Beebe did not want his biography written," says Carol Grant Gould in the preface to her workmanlike biography, raising all sorts of hopes that the following 400-plus pages slowly extinguish.</p><p> In one sense, Beebe was a biographer's dream: a compulsive journal-keeper, prolific correspondent and socially prominent figure. Gould benefited from exclusive access to his journals and letters, especially those from his longtime mistress. The biographer's curse is that his published writings were rather more interesting than his life, at least as rendered here.</p><p> His existence seems to have been free of conflict, angst or struggle. His nasty divorce from his lovely and talented first wife, which occupied the New York tabloids for weeks, is dispatched in a few terse paragraphs. Even his love affairs are handled discreetly, almost passionlessly. The author clearly preferred to concentrate on Beebe's scientific work, and as a result Beebe never truly comes alive.</p><p> But perhaps this book will spur an overdue rediscovery of Beebe's own vivid and intimate writings about nature. Perhaps his best-known work, Half Mile Down tells the sensational story of his first bathysphere descents, but it pales beside his other books, such as Edge of the Jungle, Galapagos: World's End and especially the masterful High Jungle, maybe because he was a part of the ecosystem rather than a mere observer peering through a tiny round window.</p><p> Before Beebe came along, a "naturalist" was somebody who went out and shot something, brought it home and described it. Beebe undertook the study of entire natural systems, rather than single organisms. He could spend months cataloging a few square feet of jungle floor or an eight-mile-wide "cylinder" of the sea. He is, in short, the reason every fourth-grader knows what an "ecosystem" is.</p><p> But by the 1940s -- he continued working well into his seventies -- it was clear that his natural world was under siege. The coral reefs off Bermuda had been dredged and filled, while his favorite South American jungles fell victim to logging.</p><p> One of the many young naturalists Beebe encouraged was a writer named Rachel Carson, whose Silent Spring came out in 1962, the year Beebe died. It was around then, too, that the naturalist's job changed, from documenting the profusion of nature to mourning what had disappeared. </p><p>Reviewed by Bill Gifford <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Nothing could have prepared the Spanish for the devastating implosion of 1805-14. Trafalgar destroyed its navy and the country degenerated into a brutalized shambles with French and British armies marching across it at will. The result was a war which killed over a million Spaniards and ended its empire. This book is the first in a generation to come to terms with this spectacular and terrible conflict, immortalised by Goya and the arena in which Wellington and his redcoats carved out one of the greatest episodes in British military history.</p><p>Charles Esdaile is Lecturer in Modern History at the University of Liverpool and the author of THE WARS OF NAPOLEON.The Peninsular War could fairly be called Napoleon's Vietnam-a bloody, protracted struggle, part conventional and part guerilla, that sapped the strength of the French Empire and left Spain and Portugal in ruins. This new history is a sure guide through the quagmire. The war was on one level a military epic-Napoleon's nemesis Wellington made his name on the Peninsula-and Esdaile (The Wars of Napoleon) provides an enthralling narrative of the major campaigns and battles, along with a detailed assessment of the character and quality of the armies that fought there. But he also probes the political and social dimensions of the conflict, where nothing was simple. The Bonapartist regime in Spain, he finds, combined well-meaning reform with corruption and repression; the Spanish resistance was a blend of liberal and reactionary tendencies; the celebrated Spanish guerilla fighters were often no better than bandits; and the Spanish people were by turns patriotic and apathetic, hostile to both the traditional Spanish �lites and the French interlopers who piled on new forms of exploitation. In this chaotic context, the Peninsular War became a byword for brutality: civilians were regularly pillaged and massacred by soldiers on every side acting out of starvation, reprisal for guerilla attacks or sheer drunken rage. Drawing on first-hand accounts of the conflict, Esdaile paints an indelible picture of the cruelties of Napoleonic warfare. His vigorous writing, comprehensive analysis and even-handed judgments make this an indispensable treatment of one of the watersheds of European history. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Effective Executive</h2><p><p>The measure of the executive, Peter Drucker reminds us, is the ability to "get the right things done."

Here the citizen of Hannibal, Missouri is awed by Versailles: "I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now."<br><br>Taking the measure of Michelangelo--"great in everything he undertook"--Twain nonetheless says, "I do not want Michael Angelo for breakfast--for luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for supper--for between meals.

In Pisa he designed everything but the old shot tower, and they would have attributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of the perpendicular."<br><br>The portrait of the overwhelmed tourist in INNOCENTS ABROAD is one that every reader will recognize.

His student, Lama Shenpen Drolma, has edited this collection from a variety of talks and training seminars Tulku gave during the last 14 years of his life. All individuals, Tulku believed, can benefit from Bodhisattva Peace Training, his system of teaching others to understand human interconnectedness and alleviate suffering. Tulku explores ways to develop equanimity, transform an angry heart, awaken compassion, understand the root causes of suffering, contemplate impermanence and purify oneself from within. Most of the book adopts a question-and-answer format, with dialogue taken from transcripts of Tulku's real training seminars. This give-and-take is an inherent part of the book's success in illuminating difficult teachings and placing them into some kind of practical context. In the anger chapter, for example, the students challenge Tulku to unpack his statements that "anger is never useful" or that "there is no such thing as the right to be angry." One student, an advocate for battered women, believes that abused persons can and should become angry about their circumstances, and that anger can be a catalyst to change. Tulku answers that anger is a fleeting response that cannot be depended upon to change unjust situations, and in fact usually compounds them. There is some repetition of ideas throughout the book, but considering its origin in Tulku's unedited talks, it coheres very well as a seamless whole. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mechanical engineering design (McGraw-Hill series in mechanical engineering)</h2><p>During the decades since the publication of the first edition of this handbook, more technical advances have occurred than in any other period of history.

Few perform as such in practice. In <i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Centurions, </i>distinguished historian Joseph E. Persico reveals how, during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt seized the levers of wartime power like no president since Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Declaring himself &#x201c;Dr. Win-the-War,&#x201d; FDR assumed the role of strategist in chief, and, though surrounded by star-studded generals and admirals, he made clear who was running the war. FDR was a hands-on war leader, involving himself in everything from choosing bomber targets to planning naval convoys to the design of landing craft. Persico explores whether his strategic decisions, including his insistence on the Axis powers&#x2019; unconditional surrender, helped end or may have prolonged the war.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taking us inside the Allied war councils, the author reveals how the president brokered strategy with contentious allies, particularly the iron-willed Winston Churchill; rallied morale on the home front; and handpicked a team of proud, sometimes prickly warriors who, he believed, could fight a global war. Persico&#x2019;s history offers indelible portraits of the outsize figures who roused the &#x201c;sleeping giant&#x201d; that defeated the Axis war machine: the dutiful yet independent-minded George C. Marshall, charged with rebuilding an army whose troops trained with broomsticks for rifles, eggs for hand grenades; Dwight Eisenhower, an unassuming Kansan elevated from obscurity to command of the greatest fighting force ever assembled; the vainglorious Douglas MacArthur; and the bizarre battlefield genius George S. Patton. Here too are less widely celebrated military leaders whose contributions were just as critical: the irascible, dictatorial navy chief, Ernest King; the acerbic army advisor in China, &#x201c;Vinegar&#x201d; Joe Stilwell; and Henry H. &#x201c;Hap&#x201d; Arnold, who zealously preached the gospel of modern air power. The Roosevelt who emerges from these pages is a wartime chess master guiding America&#x2019;s armed forces to a victory that was anything but foreordained.<br> &nbsp;<br> What are the qualities we look for in a commander in chief? In an era of renewed conflict, when Americans are again confronting the questions that FDR faced&#x2014;about the nature and exercise of global power&#x2014;<i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Centurions</i> is a timely and revealing examination of what it takes to be a wartime leader in a freewheeling, complicated, and tumultuous democracy.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Centurions</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;FDR&#x2019;s centurions were my heroes and guides.

On July 9, 1941, General George Catlett Marshall, Army chief of staff, appeared before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs wearing a gray civilian suit, tall, shoulders squared but not conspicuously, chin receding slightly, thin lips compressed in a line of firm resolution, a figure exuding dignity and authority. Marshall was embarked on a mission that he regarded as vital as any in his thirty-nine years in uniform, to save the still anemic United States Army from emasculation. Unless the committee could be persuaded to report favorably on a bill to extend the draft, the nation's first peacetime draftees would soon complete their required one year of service and head home. Because President Franklin Roosevelt desperately wanted the draft extended, he had sent the less politically divisive Marshall to Capitol Hill to serve as point man before the committee. Marshall began his testimony. "If the term of service of the National Guard and the selectees is not extended," he warned, "under existing limitations of the law, almost two-thirds of our enlisted men and three-fourths of our officer personnel will have to be released after completing 12 months of service." He mounted a strong finish, citing the disaster of an expired draft on a vital garrison, "the great naval base of Pearl Harbor."<br>Debate over the initial draft law the year before had been stormy. Upstate New York Republican congressman James Wadsworth introduced the legislation on June 20, 1940, two days before France gave up the fight against Nazi Germany. His championing of military service had a long pedigree. His great-grandfather, William Wadsworth, had been a major general in the War of 1812. His grandfather, also James and a Civil War general, was killed in the Battle of the Wilderness. Wadsworth himself had served in the Spanish-American War. Wads-worth's measure, HR 10132, bore the ringing title "A Bill to Protect the Integrity and Institutions of the United States Through a System of Selective Compulsory Military Training and Service." The bill called for a single year of Army service for men aged twenty-one through thirty-six. It sought to strengthen readiness, while keeping America out of the war raging in Europe by barring draftees from serving outside the United States, except in America's overseas possessions.<br><br>In the America of 1940, public interest in a far-off conflict remained low. Moviegoers were flocking to the season's hits, Walt Disney's Fantasia, W. C. Fields and Mae West in My Little Chickadee, and Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in The Philadelphia Story. Young Americans danced to the beat of Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Benny Goodman and girls swooned to a new rage, Frank Sinatra, crooning "I'll Never Smile Again." Sports fans flocked to watch their heroes of the diamond, the gridiron, the court, and the ring, Joe DiMaggio, Sammy Baugh, Don Budge, and Joe Louis. Initially, public opinion over the draft split down the middle according to a Gallup poll taken less than a month before the bill's introduction. But as Europe's dominoes began to fall before the Nazi onslaught--Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and, most shockingly, the swift collapse of France--American public opinion began to shift. By August, some six weeks after HR 10132's introduction, the latest Gallup poll showed 71 percent of Americans favoring a peacetime draft.<br><br>Still, opponents were vigorous and organized. Senator Claude Pepper of Florida spoke in favor of the bill and found himself hanged in effigy outside the Capitol by the Congress of American Mothers. "Pauline Revere," in colonial garb, rode a white horse up the Capitol steps and carried a sign that read, "Mobilize for Peace and Defeat Conscription." The isolationist America First Committee boasted among its members former President Theodore Roosevelt's outspoken daughter, Alice Longworth, aviation hero Charles Lindbergh, and Hollywood star Lillian Gish. America Firsters argued that should beleaguered Britain fall, the wisest course for America was to find an accommodation with Germany rather than embroil the country in another European war.<br><br>Tempers frayed as the debate in Congress dragged on. Martin Sweeney, an isolationist Ohio Democrat, denounced the bill as a Roosevelt ruse to drag America into the conflict. Beverly Vincent, a representative from Kentucky, called Sweeney a traitor and "a son-of-a-bitch." Sweeney took a swing at Vincent, who counterpunched with a hard right to Sweeney's head. The House doorkeeper described the fracas as the best fistfight he had witnessed in his fifty years in his post.<br><br>On September 14, after being amended thirty-three times, the draft bill carried handily by 47 to 25 votes in the Senate and by 232 to 124 in the House. Two days later, the president signed the first peacetime draft.<br><br>Registrants for the draft far exceeded the Army's needs and a national lottery was to be held to determine who would go first. The date for the lottery posed a dilemma for FDR. He was facing his precedent-shattering run for a third term and his Republican opponent, the rumpled, affable, astute Wall Street lawyer Wendell Willkie, had found his campaign issue: FDR, Willkie charged, was a warmonger. Roosevelt's political advisors pleaded with him to wait until the election was over before staging the lottery. FDR, so often accused of political sleight-of-hand, said no. He scheduled the lottery for October 29, one week before the election.<br><br>At noon, the paraplegic president, held upright by his leg braces, stood before a ten-gallon fishbowl filled with 8,500 numbers stuffed into cellulose capsules. What followed suggested the rites of a mystical fraternal society. The fishbowl containing the capsules was the one used for the World War I draft lottery. An aide blindfolded Secretary of War Henry Stimson with a strip of yellow linen from a chair used at the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Another aide stirred the capsules with a ladle carved from one of the rafters in Independence Hall. The old-fashioned Stimson, his silver hair parted in the middle, mustache bristling, exuding respectability, reached into the bowl, drew out a capsule, and handed it to the president, who read the number aloud, "One-fifty-eight!" A woman's cry broke from the audience. Mrs. Mildred Bell's twenty-one-year-old son held that number.<br><br>On the day after the lottery, Roosevelt, fearing that Willkie's "warmonger" label might stick, used a campaign speech at the Boston Garden to promise, "While I am talking to you fathers and mothers, I give you one more assurance. I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again; your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." To Sam Rosenman, FDR's close confidant, and the playwright-speechwriter Robert Sherwood, he had commented earlier, "If someone attacks us, it isn't a foreign war, is it?" FDR's son James confronted his father about the "dishonesty of his war stand." FDR explained, "If I don't say I hate war, then people are going to think I don't hate war. If I say we're going to get into this war, people will think I want us in it. If I don't say I won't send our sons to fight on foreign battlefields, then people will think I want to send them. . . . So you play the game the way it has been played over the years, and you play to win." In the end, backing the draft proved no obstacle to the president's reelection. On November 5, FDR defeated Willkie by five million votes in the popular count and by 449 electoral votes to his opponent's 82.<br><br>The draft became a popular phenomenon. Comedian Bob Hope and movie siren Dorothy Lamour starred in a film called Caught in the Draft, a wacky comedy about the futility of trying to beat the system. A comic strip called Draftie appeared. Jokes about reveille, marching, mess halls, and leather-lunged sergeants became staples for radio comedians. Young men and their families quickly mastered the thirteen draft categories ranging from 1A, the fittest, to 4F, unfit for the military. Those classified 1A began receiving letters from the government that began, "Greeting: . . . you are hereby notified that you have now been selected for immediate military service."<br><br>Baseball team owners split over the issue of deferments for their players. Warren Giles of the Cincinnati Reds professed that as far as the draft was concerned, his stars would "go just as fast as the batboy." Harry Grabiner of the White Sox argued that baseball and its stars were vital to maintaining America's morale. In the end, standouts like the Cleveland Indians' Bob Feller, the Yankees' Phil Rizzuto, and Detroit's Most Valuable Player, Hank Greenberg, were all classified 1A. So was the world heavyweight champion, Joe Louis.<br><br>Ten days after the lottery, 100,000 young Americans were out of civvies and into khaki and olive drab.<br>Almost a year passed. The twelve-month draftees were beginning to approach their discharge date when Congressman Wadsworth introduced another HR 10132 to extend their service. Once again, opponents mobilized, and the issue was debated throughout the summer of 1941 in Senate and House hearings. A full-page ad appeared in The New York Times signed by 240 educators who proclaimed, "In our view, peacetime conscription and American democracy are incompatible . . . never before in American history has it been necessary."<br><br>Jim Wadsworth gathered a group of skeptical fellow House Republicans to a private dining room in Washington's Army-Navy Club to hear Marshall make his case. One balky congressman told Marshall, "You put the case very well, but I will be damned if I am going to go along with Mr. Roosevelt." The usually unflappable Marshall exploded: "You are going to let plain hatred of the personality dictate to you to do something that you realize is very harmful to the interest of the country!" Marshall countered their doubts until two o'clock in the morning. Time magazine reported, "The President has sent in General George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, to carry the ball. Good soldier Marshall pounded down the field through center, off tackle, around the ends. . . . By now, General Marshall had smashed all the way to the one-yard line."<br><br>Not quite yet. The Senate Military Affairs Committee held hearings on July 17. The lead-off witness that day was Norman Thomas, the preeminent Socialist in the land, bland and bow-tied, looking every bit the Presbyterian minister he had once been. The Socialist Party's four-time candidate for president branded Marshall an FDR dupe. "To an extent that he may not realize, the prestige of General Marshall's name, his plans for the organization of his opinions, are being used in a great game of politics," Thomas charged, "the logical end of which is a war which 70 or possibly 80 percent of the American people do not want." He heaped scorn on FDR's recent claim that even Iceland was in the Western Hemisphere and thus needed to be defended by the United States. What was next, Thomas asked, "perhaps some lonely posts in Siberia . . . occupation of the Sahara Desert?"<br><br>Warned that passage of the bill was imperiled, FDR gave up a weekend at his beloved Hyde Park home and stayed in Washington to plot the next move. On July 21, he summoned reporters and before rolling cameras and radio microphones warned that if Congress failed to act, "beginning this autumn . . . the Army of the United States will begin to melt away." He recalled the nation's perilous birth. "The risks and weaknesses caused by dissolving a trained Army in times of national peril were pointed out by George Washington over and over again in his messages to the Continental Congress."<br><br>Hearings continued throughout a steaming summer. On July 28, Mrs. Rosa Farber, an opponent speaking for the Mothers of America before the House Committee on Military Affairs, asked, had the members forgotten the song popular when the draft had first been enacted, "Goodbye Dear, I'll Be Back in a Year"? "You talk about breaking faith with draftees," Georgia Democratic congressman Eugene Cox struck back. The congressman, described as "resembling a paunchy, aging matinee idol," asked, "But what about breaking faith with the Nation? When our country calls, who will refuse to answer? . . . Let us say to the world that we are Americans and that we mean business."<br><br>As the possibility grew that men awaiting their discharge might be kept in uniform, scrawled letters began to appear on barrack walls, latrines, and mess halls in Army posts across the country: OHIO. Passersby assumed that men from the Buckeye State were serving there. Actually, the letters stood for "Over the Hill in October." Impatient draftees reasoned that Uncle Sam had entered into a contract with them and by October they would have met their end of the bargain. They now threatened to go home, regardless of what Congress did.<br><br>As the final August 12 vote on the extension bill neared, according to the latest Gallup poll, 50 percent of Americans believed the draftees' tour should be extended while 45 percent thought they should be released. On the eve of the House vote, Turner Catledge, the New York Times political analyst, warned, "the Administration has not yet sufficiently impressed Congress and the country with the gravity of the emergency so far as it affects the self interest of the United States."<br><br>Shortly before final debate in the House, Democrat John McCormack, the majority leader, called the president's press secretary, Stephen Early, with disturbing news. McCormack warned that he could not guarantee delivery of his Democratic members for passage of the extension bill. Forty-five Democrats planned to oppose it. Thirty-five more were undecided. He had "lost control of his people," McCormack admitted.<br><br>FDR, convinced that he had personally pressed his case as far as he dared and with a secret mission occupying his thoughts, quietly slipped out of the capital aboard the presidential yacht, Potomac, for what he claimed would be ten days of fishing. The New York Times reported, "For probably the first time in history, the whereabouts of the President of the United States has been unknown for three days to the American people and to most, if not all, ranking government officials." The Times noted, "With Winston Churchill also vanished from the public eye, speculation reached a new high mark."<br><br>On August 12, House members prepared to vote on HR 10132. The speaker, Sam Rayburn, clad in his customary funereal dark suit, mounted the rostrum. To Rayburn, a fifty-nine-year-old bachelor, the House was his home, the first and last love of his life. He had come to this chamber twenty-nine years before, the end point of an extraordinary climb from Texas cotton fields tilled by him and eight siblings, through his election to the Texas legislature, to now, essentially becoming the second most powerful man in the country. At 10 a.m., Rayburn, anticipating a grueling day, called the House to order two hours earlier than usual. Fortunately, the ordinarily sweltering capital was cool with rain threatening. Reporters filled every seat in the press gallery. Depending on how one viewed the issue, the lawmakers were voting to save the Army, or to rebuff that warmonger in the White House.</p><h2>What I Learned from God While Gardening</h2><p>From best-selling author Niki Anderson, along with Cristine Bolley, comes a collection of meditations that gardeners, both long-time green thumbs and novices, will enjoy.

He looks peaked."<br>"You spoil him, Carrie. If he won't eat his dinner, don't let him go out and play. You were like that, you know."<br>"When I was his age, I was husky enough to cut down a tree with a hatchet. He couldn't cut his way out of a fog."<br>David would imagine himself invisible, floating unseen over their heads as they discussed him. Someone would ask if he had a girlfriend yet, and they would <i>tsk-tsk</i> whether the answer was yes or no. From his vantage point he would aim a ray gun at Uncle Clarence, whom he especially disliked, because he was fat, bald, and very rich. Uncle Clarence dipped his biscuits in his gravy, or in syrup, or more often in a mixture of sorghum and butter that he stirred together on his plate until it looked like baby shit.<br>"Is he still planning to be a biologist? He should go to med school and join Walt in his practice."<br>He would point his ray gun at Uncle Clarence and cut a neat plug out of his stomach and carefully ease it out, and Uncle Clarence would ooze from the opening and flow all over them.<br>"David." He started with alarm, then relaxed again. "David, why don't you go out and see what the other kids are up to?" His father's quiet voice, saying actually, That's enough of that. And they would turn their collective mind to one of the other offspring.<br>As David grew older, he learned the complex relationships that he merely accepted as a child. Uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, third cousins. And the honorary members--the brothers and sisters and parents of those who had married into the family. There were the Sumners and Wistons and O'Gradys and Heinemans and the Meyers and Capeks and Rizzos, all part of the same river that flowed through the fertile valley.<br>He remembered the holidays especially. The old Sumner house was rambling with many bedrooms upstairs and an attic that was wall-to-wall mattresses, pallets for the children, with an enormous fan in the west window. Someone was forever checking to make certain that they hadn't all suffocated in the attic. The older children were supposed to keep an eye on the younger ones, but what they did in fact was to frighten them night after night with ghost stories. Eventually the noise level would rise until adult intervention was demanded. Uncle Ron would clump up the stairs heavily and there would be a scurrying, with suppressed giggles and muffled screams, until everyone found a bed again, so that by the time he turned on the hall light that illuminated the attic dimly, all the children would seem to be sleeping. He would pause briefly in the doorway, then close the door, turn off the light, and tramp back down the stairs, apparently deaf to the renewed merriment behind him.<br>Whenever Aunt Claudia came up, it was like an apparition. One minute pillows would be flying, someone would be crying, someone else trying to read by flashlight, several of the boys playing cards by another flashlight, some of the girls huddled together whispering what had to be delicious secrets, judging by the way they blushed and looked desperate if an adult came upon them suddenly, and then the door would snap open, the light would fall on the disorder, and she would be standing there. Aunt Claudia was very tall and thin, her nose was too big, and she was tanned to a permanent old-leather color. She would stand there, immobile and terrible, and the children would creep back into bed without a sound. She would not move until everyone was back where he or she belonged, then she would close the door soundlessly. The silence would drag on and on. The ones nearest to the door would hold their breath, trying to hear breathing on the other side. Eventually someone would become brave enough to open the door a crack, and if she were truly gone, the party would resume.<br>The smells of holidays were fixed in David's memory. All the usual smells: fruit cakes and turkeys, the vinegar that went in the egg dyes, the greenery and the thick, creamy smoke of bayberry candles. But what he remembered most vividly was the smell of gunpowder that they all carried at the Fourth of July gathering. The smell that permeated their hair and clothes lasted on their hands for days and days. Their hands would be stained purple-black by berry picking, and the color and smell were one of the indelible images of his childhood. Mixed in with it was the smell of the sulfur that was dusted on them liberally to confound the chiggers.<br>If it hadn't been for Celia, his childhood would have been perfect. Celia was his cousin, his mother's sister's daughter. She was one year younger than David, and by far the prettiest of all his cousins. When they were very young they promised to marry one day, and when they grew older and it was made abundantly clear that no cousins might ever marry in that family, they became implacable enemies. He didn't know how they had been told. He was certain that no one ever put it in words, but they knew. When they could not avoid each other after that, they fought. She pushed him out of the hayloft and broke his arm when he was fifteen, and when he was sixteen they wrestled from the back door of the Winston farmhouse to the fence, fifty or sixty yards away. They tore the clothes off each other, and he was bleeding from her fingernails down his back, she from scraping her shoulder on a rock. Then somehow in their rolling and squirming frenzy, his cheek came down on her uncovered chest, and he stopped fighting. He suddenly became a melting, sobbing, incoherent idiot and she hit him on the head with a rock and ended the fight.<br>Up to that point the battle had been in almost total silence, broken only by gasps for breath and whispered language that would have shocked their parents. But when she hit him and he went limp, not unconscious, but dazed, uncaring, inert, she screamed, abandoning herself to terror and anguish. The family tumbled from the house as if they had been shaken out, and their first impression must have been that he had raped her. His father hustled him to the barn, presumably for a thrashing. But in the barn his father, belt in hand, looked at him with an expression that was furious, and strangely sympathetic. He didn't touch David, and only after he had turned and left did David realize that tears were still running down his face.<br>In the family there were farmers, a few lawyers, two doctors, insurance brokers and bankers and millers, hardware merchandisers, other shopkeepers. David's father owned a large department store that catered to the upper-middle-class clientele of the valley. The valley was rich, the farms in it large and lush. David always supposed that the family, except for a few ne'er-do-wells, was rather wealthy. Of all his relatives his favorite was his father's brother Walt. Dr. Walt, they all called him, never uncle. He played with the children and taught them grown-up things, like where to hit if you really meant it, where not to hit in a friendly scrap. He seemed to know when to stop treating them as children long before anyone else in the family did. Dr. Walt was the reason David had decided very early to become a scientist.<br>David was seventeen when he went to Harvard. His birthday was in September and he didn't go home for it. When he did return at Thanksgiving, and the clan had gathered, Grandfather Sumner poured the ritual before-dinner martinis and handed one to him. And Uncle Warner said to him, "What do you think we should do about Bobbie?"<br>He had arrived at that mysterious crossing that is never delineated clearly enough to see in advance. He sipped his martini, not liking it particularly, and knew that childhood had ended, and he felt a profound sadness and loneliness.<br>The Christmas that David was twenty-three seemed out of focus. The scenario was the same, the attic full of children, the food smells, the powdering of snow, none of that had changed, but he was seeing it from a new position and it was not the wonderland it had been. When his parents went home he stayed on at the Wiston farm for a day or two, waiting for Celia's arrival. She had missed the Christmas Day celebration, getting ready for her coming trip to Brazil, but she would be there, her mother had assured Grandmother Wiston, and David was waiting for her, not happily, not with any expectation of reward, but with a fury that grew and caused him to stalk the old house like a boy being punished for another's sin.<br>When she came home and he saw her standing with her mother and grandmother, his anger melted. It was like seeing Celia in a time distortion, as she was and would be, or had been. Her pale hair would not change much, but her bones would become more prominent and the almost emptiness of her face would have written on it a message of concern, of love, of giving, of being decisively herself, of a strength unsuspected in her frail body. Grandmother Wiston was a beautiful old lady, he thought in wonder, amazed that he never had seen her beauty before. Celia's mother was more beautiful than the girl. And he saw the resemblance to his own mother in the trio. Wordlessly, defeated, he turned and went to the rear of the house and put on one of his grandfather's heavy jackets because he didn't want to see her at all now and his own outdoor clothing was in the front hall closet too near where she was standing.<br>He walked a long time in the frosty afternoon, seeing very little, and shaking himself from time to time when he realized that the cold was entering his shoes or making his ears numb. He should turn back, he thought often, but he walked on. And he found that he was climbing the slope to the antique forest that his grandfather had taken him to once, a long time ago. He climbed and became warmer, and at dusk he was under the branches of the tiers of trees that had been there since the beginning of time. They or others that were identical to them. Waiting. Forever waiting for the day when they would start the whole climb up the evolutiona...</p><h2>Prayer &amp; Meditation - A Practical Guide Guide to the Life Promised in Step 11</h2><p>This volume is perhaps the most comprehensive work on prayer and meditation to date written exclusively for 12-step people who want more from their recovery than simply not drinking.

The local weather guy says it's a record. Not as bad as India that time the Jeep floated away, but pretty bad. Our dog, Emmy, got tired of being cooped up in the garage. She got out and ran down the driveway into the street. Aunt Maggie went nuts! She made these poor guys come in the rain and put in an invisible fence. It's this underground wire that is supposed to keep the dog in the yard. One step over it and whammo, she really gets zapped. (Don't tell Aunt Maggie,but Emmy runs right over it anyway!)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Ten-year-old Jesse reread his e-mail. He hadn't included the information that the dog had turned back into a dragon for an instant the first time she was zapped, and that Mrs. Nosy-Britches, who lived across the street, was standing at her mailbox at the exact moment the zap happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"It's the oddest thing," Mrs. Nosy-Britches kept saying to anyone who would listen, "but I could swear I saw this very large lizard in the driveway across the street. If I didn't know better, I'd swear it was some sort of a dragon."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Jesse finished and sent the e-mail. He listened to the rain rattling on the roof and watched the slide show on the screen saver. The pictures were of him and his parents in some of the places where they had traveled and lived. Looking at it made him happy, if a little homesick for his parents and even the places: India, Africa, Costa Rica. . . . When he had first come to America to stay with his cousin Daisy, who was also ten, he had been so homesick that he had worn two wristwatches, one showing the time in the U.S. and the other the time in Africa, where his parents were. These days he wore just the one watch showing American time, but when there wasn't quite enough to keep him busy, like now, he missed his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Jesse was just shutting down the computer when he heard Daisy scream out his name. He leaped up, tore downstairs, slid down the hall in his socks, and collided with the kitchen table.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"What?" he said, panting. "What is it, Daze?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Daisy was standing on a footstool gazing out the window over the sink. Her long white-blond hair was tucked behind her ears, which were pointy like an elf's and bright pink with excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Jess, look!" she said, tapping the windowpane.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Jesse looked, but the panes were fogging up from Daisy's breath. "What are we looking at?" he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Don't you see?" Daisy whispered. "There and there?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Jesse boosted himself up onto the edge of the sink, leaned over, and rubbed a clear spot in the bottom pane. He stared hard through the porthole into the side yard. Trunks and leaves and branches were all churned up into one great green swarming, sopping mess.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Boy, oh, boy," he said, mustering some appreciation for the view. "The wind sure is blowing hard."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Daisy tugged impatiently at the hood of his sweatshirt. "The two trees, Jess. See them?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Which two trees?" he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>She groaned. "Get down and let me look."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>They switched places. Daisy pointed and said, "They're standing right there, exactly ten feet from the house. I swear, Jess, those trees were not there before."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Jesse shivered. "How can you tell?" he asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Simple. There isn't either a Douglas fir or a quaking aspen growing in our side yard," Daisy said, getting down from the sink. "Plus they both have a bright strip of cloth or ribbon or something wrapped around their trunks. You can't miss them." &nbsp; Even though he had been living in Daisy's house for nearly six months, Jesse didn't know every tree in the yard. That was Daisy's thing. Her favorite saying was "Not knowing the names of the flowers and the trees is like not knowing the names of your own sisters and brothers."</p><h2>The Real Thief</h2><p><p>Gawain is a loyal and true goose serving as chief guard of the royal treasury. He'd been happy enough with his life at home tending his garden and making sketches of architectural masterpieces. Now he's being charged with stealing from the treasury. Gawain is certain of his innocence, but he can't prove it. Will the real thief come forward to save Gawain, or will he live in exile forever?</p></p><p>Who hasn't known the sickening, demoralizing feeling of being falsely accused? In <i>The Real Thief</i>, William Steig explores this injustice with the keen insight of a good psychologist and the skillful pacing of a brilliant storyteller. Gawain is a goose, a guard for the new Royal Treasury, and intensely loyal to the honey-scented, gruff, fatherly King Basil the bear: "He wanted to please him, to stay forever in his gruff, good graces. Everyone did. Basil was a popular king." The Royal Treasury consists of jewels, medallions, and precious crowns of historical interest--and the only creatures who have keys to the Treasury are Gawain and the King himself. One fateful day, Gawain discovers to his horror that the pile of rubies is smaller than it should be. He hurries to tell the King, and they both rush back to count them: "Sure enough, there were only 8,643 of the red gems when there should have been 8,672." Day after day, treasures continue to disappear, including the world-famous Kalikak diamond! <p> The King is flummoxed. He calls a meeting of his Royal Cabinet, who finally persuade him that the thief must be his faithful Gawain, whom he loves like a son: "He sent his councilors away and slumped in his throne, dejected. Having listened to an opinion he didn't really believe but was forced to respect, he grew confused and fell into muddled ponderings." That very night Gawain is rousted out of bed at midnight and dragged to the castle dungeon. A trial is held a few days later, and the innocent goose is found guilty, his name disgraced forever. He hates the ones he had trusted and loved for seeing evil in him that isn't there, and he flies the coop before he can be locked away. The real thief? That is for the reader to discover. In this simple fable of justice, loyalty, friendship, and betrayal, Steig again manages to portray a reflection of life so heart-rendingly accurate it's uncanny. Children will be on the edge of their seats throughout this powerful, suspenseful tale, and visibly relieved by the happy, forgiving ending.

But he is drawn to the silent, slow-moving caterpillar in the jar next to his desk. He knows caterpillars turn into butterflies, but just how do they do it? To find out, he studies the words in a butterfly book so many times that he can close his eyes and see the black letters, but he still can&#39;t understand their meaning. Illustrated with paintings as deep and rich as the wings of a butterfly, this honest, unsentimental account of a schoolchild&#39;s struggle to learn language reveals that our imaginations powerfully sustain us. La Mariposa makes a subtle plea for tolerance in our homes, our communities, and in our schools.</p><p>Francisco Jim�nez emigrated from Tlaquepaque,Mexico, to California, where he worked for many years in the fields with his family. He received both his master's degree and his Ph.D. fromColumbia University and is now the professor emeritus in the ModernLanguages and LiteratureDepartment at Santa Clara University, thesetting of much of his novel,&nbsp;<i>Reaching Out.

The cacophony of voices all speaking English, a language he doesn't understand, leaves him apprehensive and headachy. He fares no better in the classroom. Though he tries to listen, he is often overwhelmed and his mind drifts. His only solaces are drawing and watching a caterpillar in a jar on the science shelf. At recess, he plays with a child who speaks a little Spanish, only to be scolded by his teacher for not speaking English. During the winter, seeing that Francisco has no jacket, the principal gives him one from the lost and found. It proves to belong to a classmate who wrestles Francisco to the ground and accuses him of stealing it. The child withdraws even further. However, by the end of the year, he, like the butterfly, unfolds from his cocoon and begins to gain confidence. The story is open-ended, with no real resolution, and the episodic plot does not make for a compelling narrative. The strength of the book lies in its ability to capture the frustration and isolation experienced by children who do not speak the dominant language. Potent as a discussion starter, La Mariposa helps readers identify with and build empathy for the protagonist. Silva's acrylic illustrations, using strong lines and bold colors, are a bit overwhelming for the quiet story at times, but are eye-catching nonetheless.

"It's the <em>S.S. Evangelical Gospel.</em> In the midst of their fun and excitement, passengers have not noticed holes in the ship's side under the water line. Well-meaning leaders are attempting to plug these holes with new methods, technology, social activism and cultural savvy. All these are important, yet the structure of the ship remains compromised by years of neglect." In this thoroughly revised fourth edition of the now classic <em>Tell the Truth,</em> Will Metzger reinstates the truth framework necessary for the survival of evangelicalism. Biblical illiteracy among evangelicals is on the rise. Theological discernment between truth and error is increasingly elusive. We need to be recalibrated not to the changing times but to the changeless gospel.

The authors show how contemporary theories such as transformational leadership, authentic leadership, and servant leadership take an important step toward prioritizing and empowering followers who work with leaders to accomplish organizational goals. Irving and Strauss organize their book around "nine empowering practices," making it accessible to students, church leaders, and business leaders.<br><br>Integrating solid research in leadership studies with biblical and theological reflection on the leadership ideas that are most compatible with Christian faith, this book is an important resource for all Christian students of leadership.</p><p><b>"A clear and comprehensive overview of Christian leadership"<br></b><br>"Irving and Strauss intentionally set out on a daunting task to deliver a fully integrated and biblically rooted perspective on Christian leadership. The genius of their work is found in the integration of models and what then emerges. Empowerment becomes the thread that connects them all.

There she rides her beloved horses and enjoys visits from the Hungarian statesman Count Andr�ssy, the man with whom she&#x2019;s unwittingly fallen in love.

Had someone asked her, it would have been simple enough for her to provide an answer. But what was the truth? she wondered. Why was it that twilight here in G�d�ll&#x151;, her country estate just outside of Budapest, felt so different from twilight in Vienna?<br><br>She might have said that it was the view: the unruly, wild, perfectly inviting view. Here, in the soft light of the coming evening, the grounds rolled open before her, unfurling in waves of gentle green before meeting thousands of acres of virgin woodlands. Clusters of wildflowers dotted the meadows, so different from Vienna&#x2019;s imperial grounds and gardens, where sensible, stately tulips intersected lawns so symmetrical and tight clipped that it looked as though mankind had heeled nature into complete submission. Which of course, in Vienna, it had.<br><br>Or was it the sound of G�d�ll&#x151; at dusk? Evenings out here echoed with the bark of her sheepdogs; the carefree laughter of the Hungarian stable boys as they scrubbed down her horses; the first stirrings of the crickets and frogs as they welcomed dusk from the overgrown fields, nature&#x2019;s unrivaled orchestra tuning up for its nightly symphony. It was a collection of sounds so entirely unlike those to be had in Vienna, where Sisi might hear the one-�two of polished boots as the imperial guards paraded across the courtyards; the clatter of coaches rolling past the Hofburg gates; the cries of the Viennese mob gathered outside the palace at all hours, begging for her to give them a florin coin or a glimpse of her celebrated silhouette, her legendary hairstyles.<br><br>Perhaps it was the aroma in the air. Here a medley of sweet scents traveled across the breeze: the faint trace of wild rose and acacia, the earthy musk of the stables, the heady perfume of overgrown grass and straw and mud. It was a lush bouquet of smells so natural and pleasing, entirely different from what she might breathe in back in Vienna, where she inhaled the cloying eau de parfum of obsequious courtiers; the stink of so many bodies and chamber pots jammed into the Hofburg Palace; the fear of the noble men and women who were always watching, calculating as to how they might raise their own status or knock down a rival&#x2019;s. Yes, fear was something one could smell. Sisi knew that, after all of her years in Vienna.<br><br>But no, it was not the view, or the sound, or the scent that made twilight in Hungary so different from twilight in Austria. It was not anything outside of her or around her; it was a sensation entirely inside of her. It was how she felt each evening at dusk that made G�d�ll&#x151; so different from the Hofburg.<br><br>In Vienna, by this hour of the day, Sisi would feel withered. Her head would ache from the unpleasantness of an argument with her husband or his iron-�willed mother. Sisi&#x2019;s stomach would be coiled into a gnarled mess, her chest tight with anxiety from a day of sorting gossip and rumors from truth, of watching for and trying to address the judgment or disapproval that seemed to pass across every courtier&#x2019;s face. She would be looking drearily ahead to a night spent with the Imperial Court&#x2014;�a tedious evening ensconced in the damask and gold gilt of the staterooms, the sound of the violins overpowered by the chatter about trivial scandals. Hours spent watching women fawn before her husband, forcing a weary smile while men paid her the same trite compliments they used night after night. Days in Vienna were long, but the nights were interminable&#x2014;�and Sisi would limp back to her room each evening feeling spent, depleted. So fatigued that she already dreaded the next day before that day even came.<br><br>Here in G�d�ll&#x151; she felt spent, too, but in the best way possible. Like a vessel poured out, light and free of burdens. Today, like all days at her Hungarian estate, she&#x2019;d been free. She&#x2019;d been outdoors since five in the morning, having risen at four. In keeping with her daily routine, she&#x2019;d ridden hard and returned to the palace just briefly for a light broth at midday. The afternoon found her atop her horse once more and back in the fields and woodlands, where she practiced jumps, galloped to the point of breathlessness, and joined her charming neighbor, Prince Nikolaus Esterh�zy, in chasing foxes and racing across the untamed landscape.<br><br>That was why twilight in G�d�ll&#x151; was always so different. By the time the sun began to sink over the western fields in the direction of Budapest, Sisi&#x2019;s body would ache with a pleasant, well-�earned fatigue. Her cheeks, brightened by the clean country air and the physical exertion, would glow a deep rose. Her heart would feel light, her spirits buoyant, and her body strong.<br><br>And that was precisely how Sisi felt on this sultry late-�summer evening, as she handed her horse off at the stables and thanked the Hungarian groom with an easy smile. She turned toward the palace, its red-�domed roof cutting a fanciful outline against the fading sky. Even this structure, so whimsical and unpretentious, stood in contrast to the stately, solid form of Vienna&#x2019;s imperial residence, the Hofburg. As Sisi looked now over the strawberry-�pink and cream fa�ade, her eyes moved to the second floor, finding the window on the eastern wing of the house. She smiled, picking up her pace. She had almost expected to see the tiny cherubic face peeking back at her from within a glow of early-�evening candlelight; and suddenly she couldn&#x2019;t wait to be back inside the palace, this place where she had made a home for herself, carving out a safe corner of domesticity and freedom away from the crushing hold of Vienna and the Imperial Court.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Shadow.&#x201d; Sisi&#x2019;s favorite dog, an oversized mound of wagging white fur, trotted up, lapping a sloppy greeting on her as she reached the front door. &#x201c;You miss me today?&#x201d; She stroked the massive hound a moment before nodding at the nearby footman and walking into the front hall, her dog trailing behind her in accordance with his name.<br><br>&#x201c;Empress Elisabeth.&#x201d; Ida Ferenczy, Sisi&#x2019;s attendant and longtime friend, curtsied as the empress entered. Beside her snored the empress&#x2019;s other dog, a heavy Saint Bernard named Brave. Her mother-�in-�law despised oversized dogs&#x2014;�the Archduchess Sophie only ever kept dogs small enough to sit in her lap. Perhaps that was why here, in G�d�ll&#x151;, Sisi surrounded herself with the enormous, lovable beasts.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Ida.&#x201d; Sisi tossed her riding gloves onto a nearby chair as she crossed the spacious, high-�ceilinged front hall toward her attendant. &#x201c;I will change quickly out of these riding clothes. I miss my little one. Is everything as it should be in the nursery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Archduchess Valerie is in perfectly good health this evening, thanks be to God.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has she cried today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only the normal fretting of any small baby. But the nurse reports that the little archduchess has had her milk without incident, and she should be in good spirits for Your Majesty&#x2019;s visit to the nursery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll change and then go straight to her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. And was Your Majesty&#x2019;s ride pleasing today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Sisi nodded, making her way to the broad, curving staircase that led upstairs toward her suite of private rooms. &#x201c;It was a wonderful day. The fox thought he had found a safe haven in the southern woodlands, but Nicky rooted him out, and we nearly&#x2014;�&#x201d; Sisi paused on the steps, her mind pulled in several directions at once. &#x201c;That reminds me, Ida, we shall be four for dinner tonight instead of three. Nicky&#x2014;�rather, Prince Esterh�zy&#x2014;�practically begged me for an invitation, and I hadn&#x2019;t the heart to refuse him. He&#x2019;ll join the two of us and Countess Marie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In that case, Madame, I believe that we shall be five instead of four.&#x201d; Ida&#x2019;s lips curled upward in a sheepish smile, but she offered nothing more by way of explanation.<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Sisi asked, her hand bracing on the stairway&#x2019;s carved balustrade. &#x201c;Who else is coming?&#x201d; Had Franz decided to plan a last-�minute visit? Sisi&#x2019;s stomach coiled&#x2014;�the emperor&#x2019;s presence, as rare as it was out here, had a way of disrupting the fragile, carefree peace she fought so hard to cultivate in this household.<br><br>As an answer, Ida held forth the small golden mail dish, piled with papers. &#x201c;Your Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s personal correspondences.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Sisi took the dish, riffling through the pile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve forwarded all of the official petitions and letters on to my secretary in Vienna?&#x201d;<br><br>Ida nodded.<br><br>Sisi&#x2019;s eyes landed on the one calling card, its lettering long and graceful&#x2014;�and familiar. No, this was not news of the emperor. This was a sight so longed for that Sisi felt her heart lurch in her breast, aching now with the first kindling of hope. Andr�ssy! But could it be? Was Andr�ssy back in Hungary? Sisi fixed a questioning gaze on her attendant, aware of how her eager tone betrayed her as she asked: &#x201c;Did he . . . did Count Andr�ssy come by today?&#x201d;<br><br>Leaning forward, her voice low, Ida whispered: &#x201c;Count Andr�ssy came calling while you were riding. He said he&#x2019;d return for dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>Sisi clutched the banister, her heart feeling like it might trip down the carpeted stairs even as she stood frozen in place. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a surprise. A most pleasant surprise. Come, I must dress at once.&#x201d;<br><br>As she dressed for the evening, Sisi made her way through the remaining pile of letters, her mind wandering every few moments back to Andr�ssy. Had he missed her these past months as she had missed him? How long would he stay? Would all be the same between them? She blinked, forcing herself to focus on the news from her family; she had only so much time to read these letters and visit the nursery before dinner. Before he arrived.<br><br>There were several letters from Bavaria, where Sisi&#x2019;s beloved older sister, Helene, had recently returned to the family home at Possenhofen to live with their parents. &#x201c;Poor N�n�.&#x201d; Sisi could almost see the tears that had fallen as her widowed sister penned this note. Helene, the eldest sister and the only one of the five Wittelsbach girls to be happily married, had found her groom&#x2014;�a kindly prince of Thurn and Taxis&#x2014;�later in life. She hadn&#x2019;t married until her twenties, and yet she&#x2019;d lost her husband just a few precious years after the wedding. Helene wrote of her own deteriorating health, of her daily sadness, but also of her deepening faith. She, who had once longed for a life in a nunnery, wrote Sisi now that daily prayer provided &#x201c;the one balm against grief in the otherwise chaotic environment of our childhood household.&#x201d;<br><br>Sisi sighed, her heart heavy for Helene as she turned to her next letter from home. This one came from her darling younger sister Sophie-�Charlotte.<br><br>My dearest Sisi,<br><br>I am to be married! You cannot possibly know how happy my heart is. Or perhaps you can, and do, understand my bliss; I was too young to witness it when you yourself fell in love with your husband and accepted his hand.<br><br>Sisi looked away for a moment, blinking as she absorbed the startling news. If N�n�&#x2019;s letter had seeped sad resignation, a contemplative widow&#x2019;s acceptance that her life&#x2019;s dreams would never be realized, then Sophie-�Charlotte&#x2019;s note burst with youthful cheer, raw and na�ve exuberance, an as yet unshaken optimism that felt as fragile and ill-�fated as a bowl of blown glass in a child&#x2019;s hands. Sisi turned back to her sister&#x2019;s words.<br><br>Oh, my darling sister, you know our cousin Ludwig as well as I do. Perhaps even better, as he always tells me that you alone of the sisters (other than me, of course!) truly know him and love him. And how he returns that love to you! How he admires you! And how happy it makes me when he tells me that I, of all our sisters, most resemble you in beauty and sensitivity.<br><br>Oh, Sisi, mine is a blissful, giddy state of happiness. Ludwig, King of Bavaria, to be my husband!<br><br>He is a man without equal. Why, look at his palaces. He has taste and elegance enough to make me feel like quite the simpleton. And not to mention how beautiful he is to look on. I know that every girl in Bavaria is sick with envy, as they should be. I have won for myself the best husband in our country! Perhaps the world! (Your beloved Franz Joseph excluded, of course.)<br><br>You will come home to Bavaria for the wedding, won&#x2019;t you? I shall tell Ludwig that you will&#x2014;�the promise of seeing you will induce him to name a wedding date!<br><br>I am now and shall remain your most loving and devoted sister,<br><br>Sophie-�Charlotte<br><br>Sisi put Sophie-�Charlotte&#x2019;s letter down and folded it twice, an inexplicable sense of uneasiness settling over her. She was taken aback that the happy news filled her with such misgivings. Her sister was correct: Sisi did love Ludwig. He was her cousin and&#x2014;�other than N�n�&#x2014;�her most cherished childhood playmate. She and Ludwig had spent so much of their youths together in Bavaria, the two of them running wild through the fields around Possenhofen and sharing their fantastic daydreams for both the present and the future. Perhaps Ludwig had even been a bit in love with the young Sisi. He had hinted at it enough. <br><br>But Ludwig&#x2014;�now to be Sophie-�Charlotte&#x2019;s husband? The idea did not fill Sisi with the joy that such news ought to have aroused. Were they well suited? Certainly her mother, Duchess Ludovika, would be elated at such a match, thrilled by the fact that her youngest daughter would remain so close to her home in &#x201c;Possi.&#x201d; And Sophie-�Charlotte was euphoric, evidently. Sisi tucked her sister&#x2019;s note into her escritoire, determined to revisit the topic later. She did not wish to rob her darling baby sister of any of her bridal joy, but neither did she herself have the most optimistic view of matrimony these days. She&#x2019;d need to think before crafting her reply.<br><br>Only two letters remained, and Sisi stared at them now. The top one bore the seal of archduchess gisela, imperial princess of austria and hungary. Gisela, Sisi&#x2019;s twelve-�year-�old daughter, writing from the Imperial Court in Vienna. Gisela rarely wrote. She and Sisi were not close; they had never been given a chance at closeness. Gisela, from her earliest days as an infant, had preferred her grandmother, the Archduchess Sophie, the woman who could somehow be as soft and maternal with her grandchildren as she was cold and domineering with her daughter-�in-�law.</p><h2>fast2cut Bonnie K.

This fourth edition has a couple of noteworthy differences and advantages from the third hardcover edition. First of all, this important resource is now able to be distributed to Christian inmates (hardcover books are not permitted in prison). Second, in order to make the book more portable and affordable, chapters 30 and 31 (which presented the fictional but true-to-life account of "Al" and "Jan") have been extracted. The material from these two chapters is contained in a separate book: A Calvinist's Honest Doubts. Lastly, documentation and formatting have been fine-tuned to improve accuracy and readability. We trust that even more readers will be blessed by the availability and increased "share-ability" of this important work. Discussions with many people around the world reveal that multitudes of sincere, Bible-believing Christians are "Calvinists" only by defalt. It takes only a few simple questions to discover the fact that most of those who regard themselves as Calvinists are largely unaware of what John Calvin and his early followers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries actually believed and pracitice. Nor do they fully understand what most of today's leading Calvinists believe. What Love Is This? exposes the true beliefs of Calvinism and addresses all the issues surrounding this doctrine.

Perseverance of the Saints</p><p>Born in 1926, Dave enjoyed the advantages of a godly upbringing, and placed his trust in Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and Lord in his early teens. He received a degree in mathematics from U.C.L.A. Marriage to his wife, Ruth, was followed by the birth of four children, a career as CPA/management consultant and, later, the management of several corporations. Along with church-related activities, Dave initiated and became involved in numerous campus ministries and meetings in his home, with a special outreach to Jewish young people and foreign students. Since 1973 Dave&#x2019;s desire for fulltime ministry has found fulfillment through authorship of books dealing with the incursion, into Western culture and the church itself, of Eastern, psychological and selfist philosophies, ecumenism, and other unbiblical teachings. Concern over Islamic politics and religion are reflected in current articles, lectures and interviews. At least 4 million copies of his books have been sold and have been translated into more than 50 languages. They include: The Cult Explosion, The God Makers, The New Spirituality, The Seduction of Christianity, Global Peace and the Rise of Antichrist, Occult Invasion, A Cup of Trembling, In Defense of the Faith, An Urgent Call to a Serious Faith , What Love Is This?, Countdown to the Second Coming, Seeking and Finding God, Honest Doubts, Judgment Day! Islam, Israel, and the Nations, Yoga and the Body of Christ, and his latest book, Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny. His video, Israel, Islam &amp; Armageddon has become a tremendous tool for churches and others interested in helping spread the truth about events prior to and since the attack on the World Trade Center. Dave&#x2019;s impeccable research and recognized scholarship are based on in depth studies of original documents and publications, interviews with key experts from around the world, and extensive travel&#x2014;including to South America, Australia, Europe and throughout the Middle East. Dave Hunt is the founder of The Berean Call, based in Bend, Oregon. Friday, April 5, 2013, Dave Hunt drew his final breath and entered into the presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. His beloved wife Ruth was at his side."

And that is why I congratulate Dave Hunt for writing this excellent clarification of the doctrine that has its roots more in Greek humanism, from where it originated, than it does in Scripture.... Every evangelical minister should read this book. If they did, we would see a mighty revival of soul-winning passion that would turn this world upside down as multitudes saw the real God of the Bible, not the false God of Augustinianism and Calvinism. TIM LAHAYE, Author of more than 50 books and co-author of the Left Behind Series<br> <br> Dave Hunt has done it again....stirred the Christian community into taking a serious look at the aberrant teachings... of John Calvin...and thoroughly documents his findings. It is a, must-read for those who are serious in their desire to understand the influence that Calvin has had and continues to have on the Evangelical church. CHUCK SMITH, Pastor, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa<br> <br> Dave Hunt has given exact details to show the agonizing faults of Calvinistic abuses that most people have not considered. ELMER L. TOWNS, Dean, School of Religion, Liberty University<br> <br> This book exposes traditional Calvinism for portraying God in a totally unscriptural manner....[and] will stand as a definitive work on the subject. WILLIAM MACDONALD, Author of more than 80 books in 100 languages<br> <br> Dave Hunt continues his intrepid commitment to revealing the truth however unfashionable or politically incorrect it may be deemed. Blind-fold your prejudices and be ready for a stunning and desperately needed perspective on this highly controversial area. Here is another essential for the serious student of God's Word. DR. CHUCK MISSLER, Founder, Koinonia House<br> <br> Rarely has anyone undertaken the exhaustive task of detailing and documenting the misconception of God's sovereign grace as has Dave Hunt....This book needs to be read by every communicator of the Gospel.... ARNO FROESE, Executive Director, Midnight Call Ministry Editor, Midnight Call<br> <br> This incredible book by Dave Hunt is imperative...[and] exposes the horror of spiritual apartheid for what it really is. Calvinism makes our Heavenly Father look like the worst of despots and I join Dave in declaring Him: Not Guilty! JOSEPH R. CHAMBERS, DD, DSL, Pastor, author, and radio host<br> <br> Dave Hunt has given us a fascinating expose of modern five-point Calvinism that is both highly readable and practical. I especially enjoyed the section on perseverance and assurance of salvation.&nbsp; BOB WILKIN, PH.D., Founder and Executive Director, Grace Evangelical Society<br> <br> As a biblicist, I find this to be a refreshing biblical review of things which for many years have brought confusion to believers. We've allowed words and ideas of men to determine our positions. This book reminds us to listen to what the Word of God has to say. HARRY BOLLBACK, Co-founder with Jack Wyrtzen of Word of Life International<br> <br> In Dave's book, we are challenged to go back to the Scriptures as we evaluate the workings of God on this all-important subject of salvation. This is definitely a book that causes us to reflect on how we formulate our doctrine. JOE JORDAN, Executive Director, Word of Life Fellowship, Inc.<br> <br> I am glad to see Dave deal with a tough subject, supply materials that many of us have not accessed until now, and challenge the Biblical basis for tulip.

Long associated with skid row, saloons, freak shows, violence, and vice, the Bowery often showed the worst New York City had to offer. Yet there were times when it showed its best as well.<br><br>The Bowery is New York&#x2019;s oldest street and Manhattan&#x2019;s broadest boulevard. Like the city itself, it has continually reinvented itself over the centuries. Named for the Dutch farms, or <i>bouweries</i>, of the area, the path&#x2019;s lurid character was established early when it became the site of New Amsterdam&#x2019;s first murder. A natural spring near the Five Points neighborhood led to breweries and taverns that became home to the gangs of New York&#x2014;the &#x201c;Bowery B&#x2019;hoys,&#x201d; &#x201c;Plug Uglies,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dead Rabbits.&#x201d; In the Gaslight Era, teenaged streetwalkers swallowed poison in McGurk&#x2019;s Suicide Hall.&nbsp;<br><br>A brighter side to the street was reflected in places of amusement and culture over the years. A young P.T. Barnum got his start there, and Harry Houdini learned showmanship playing the music halls and dime museums.

Tortured by the unsolved slayings of his wife and young daughter, he is a man consumed by guilt, regret, and the desire for revenge. When his former partner asks him to track down a missing girl, Parker finds himself drawn into a world beyond his imagining: a world where thirty-year-old killings remain shrouded in fear and lies, a world where the ghosts of the dead torment the living, a world haunted by the murderer responsible for the deaths in his family&#x2014;a serial killer who uses the human body to create works of art and takes faces as his prize. But the search awakens buried instincts in Parker: instincts for survival, for compassion, for love, and, ultimately, for killing.<br> <br>Aided by a beautiful young psychologist and a pair of bickering career criminals, Parker becomes the bait in a trap set in the humid bayous of Louisiana, a trap that threatens the lives of everyone in its reach. Driven by visions of the dead and the voice of an old black psychic who met a terrible end, Parker must seek a final, brutal confrontation with a murderer who has moved beyond all notions of humanity, who has set out to create a hell on earth: the serial killer known only as the Traveling Man.<br> <br>In the tradition of classic American detective fiction, <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is a tense, richly plotted thriller, filled with memorable characters and gripping action. It is also a profoundly moving novel, concerned with the nature of loyalty, love, and forgiveness. Lyrical and terrifying, it is an ambitious debut, triumphantly realized.</p><p>It's a good idea to avoid reading John Connolly's debut novel on a full stomach. His descriptions of mutilated murder victims give him honorary membership in the gore wars club. <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is a fast-paced piece of fiction from an author whose regular stomping ground is as a journalist for the <i>Irish Times</i>. <p> NYPD detective Charlie "Bird" Parker was busy boozing at Tom's Oak Tavern when his wife Susan, and young daughter Jennifer were mutilated by a killer called the Traveling Man. Consumed by guilt and alcoholism, Charlie soon lost his job, and almost his sanity. Several months on he is sober and ready to get his life back in order. Charlie takes up private investigating. One of his first cases involves the disappearance of a woman called Catherine Demeter. At first this puzzle seems unrelated to the Traveling Man--but Charlie has a gut feeling that the slayer is pulling the strings. "I dreamed of Catherine Demeter surrounded by darkness and flames and the bones of dead children. And I knew then that some terrible blackness had descended upon her."</p><p> The search for Catherine takes Charlie on a whirlwind tour of the South. First to the small Virginian town of Haven, where, some 30 years before, Catherine's sister Amy was murdered, along with other local children. But the trail turns cold--until a tip from a psychic leads Charlie to the swamplands of Louisiana. The subplots of Catherine's disappearance, age-old child murders, and the slaying of the Parker family finally unite in the hot, humid terrain. A showdown with the Traveling Man is inevitable.</p><p> <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is classic American crime fiction, and it's hard to believe that John Connolly was born and raised on the Emerald Isle. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of thrillers, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes</i>, the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

These compounds act synergistically to orchestrate all the reactions in our bodies. When some nutrients are missing, though, the body cannot function properly; and when many nutrients are missing for an extended period of time, the body can become diseased. Obesity, chronic inflammation, food allergies, infertility, and many other diseases stem from the body&#x2019;s being starved of essential nutrients&#x2014;nutrients that are lacking in a diet of processed foods.<br><br>Food Is a Signaling Substance<br><br>It is easy to lose sight of the reasons we eat. We feel hungry, and immediately we think of calories&#x2014;of eating to fill up. The real reasons our bodies need food go beyond the ingestion of calories, though. Food, by nature, is a signaling substance.<br><br>The chemical composition of food&#x2014;its vitamins and phytochemicals&#x2014;sends signals to our cells designating how the genes will express themselves; this means that every time we eat, we are telling our bodies which genes to turn on and which genes to turn off. Did you know that there is more gene expression within two hours of eating than at any other time of the day? This is the fascinating world of nutrigenomics&#x2014;the idea that food is information not merely calories.<br><br>Processed Foods and Gene Expression<br><br>With an understanding of gene expression, you can see that when you eat a diet of processed foods full of chemicals and devoid of nutrients, you are telling your genes to &#x201c;turn on&#x201d; for certain diseases you may be predisposed to. On the other hand, when you eat a whole foods diet rich in plants, the opposite is possible.<br><br>Research has indicated that a plant-rich whole foods diet can communicate to your genes in a way that may prevent and/or alter disease progression. For example, a child could have the genetic makeup that predisposes him to type 1 diabetes. With a diet of processed foods devoid of nutrients and high in gluten, dairy, sugar, and nonfood constituents, he could develop this disease in childhood. If the mother has a gluten-free, dairy-free, nutrient-dense diet from the time of conception, the baby would more likely not develop diabetes.<br><br>If you want to lower the risk of developing allergies and disease, then you can change the way your genes are being expressed by eliminating all processed foods and eating a nutrient-dense, organic whole foods diet.<br><br>What Constitutes a Processed Food?<br><br>There is a lot of debate about what actually constitutes a &#x201c;processed food.&#x201d; In reality, there is a continuum of processing of foods that ranges from naturally preserved foods (like home-canned tomatoes or frozen berries), to completely denatured foods (such as high fructose corn syrup). Foods that undergo minimal processing can still be nutritious; these include extra-virgin olive oil, virgin coconut oil, and raw apple cider vinegar. Highly processed foods include man-made pseudo-foods such as artificial sweeteners and hydrogenated oils. Additionally, processed foods often have nonfood constituents, like bleaching agents, solvents, and alkalizing agents, as well as often being fortified with synthetic vitamins. For our purposes here, processed foods are those that are highly processed&#x2014;that is, those that are entirely man-made or have had parts removed or added, such as the refining of corn into high fructose corn syrup or the bleaching and enriching of white flour.<br><br>What&#x2019;s in a Chicken Sandwich?<br><br>Take an unassuming grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and melted cheese&#x2014;something you might choose when dining out. Let&#x2019;s throw in a side of fries and a diet soda. Seems pretty straightforward, right?<br><br>What you don&#x2019;t see are the large amounts of chemicals that were used on the genetically engineered grains or the arsenic that was added to the feed the chicken ate, whose meat now contains those chemicals, and the antibiotics that were added prophylactically to its feed. You don&#x2019;t see the pesticide residues on the lettuce or tomato&#x2014;chemicals that are never tested for human safety. You don&#x2019;t see rBGH, a genetically engineered hormone that was injected into the cows to produce more milk and is now in that cheese.<br><br>What about the toxic combination of artificial sweeteners and caffeine in your soft drink? It has neuroexcitatory toxins that can kill brain cells and cause migraines and joint pain. How about a little sodium acid pyrophosphate to maintain color, or dimethylpolysiloxane to prevent foaming in your fries? Unfortunately, these chemicals are in most seemingly &#x201c;natural&#x201d; fries when you dine out.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s not forget the bun. Not only is it made from refined wheat&#x2014;white flour&#x2014; that can be highly inflammatory, but it also most likely contains ingredients you can&#x2019;t pronounce. If you wouldn&#x2019;t keep a jar of these unpronounceable ingredients in your kitchen cabinet, then they don&#x2019;t belong in your diet.<br><br>Loss of Nutrients<br><br>Not only are many processed foods full of genetically engineered ingredients and unnatural chemicals, but they are high in calories and low in nutrients. A diet of processed foods essentially starves your body while at the same time causing weight gain, as the body, in its innate wisdom, keeps demanding more food in order to get the necessary vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids.<br><br>When a food item is processed, such as with the polishing of brown rice to make white rice, many essential nutrients and fibers are lost that could be used by the body for properly digesting the grain. In the late 1800s, a Japanese doctor made the connection between the disease beriberi and a diet consisting mainly of polished, or white, rice. This marked the discovery of thiamine, or vitamin B1. Thiamine is found in the outer portion of rice, or the bran; this portion is removed when brown rice is polished into white rice. Thiamine and also biotin help the body utilize its blood sugar by bringing glucose into the powerhouse of the cell&#x2014;the mitochondria&#x2014;to be burned for energy. Yet thiamine and biotin are just two of the nutrients that get stripped away during processing. Furthermore, consuming white rice causes the blood sugar to spike, as the fiber that slows down the release of sugar into the blood stream has been removed. In essence, the majority of helpful vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that were present in the outer portion of the brown rice kernel are lost when the rice is polished.<br><br>Remember that it&#x2019;s fine to eat a small amount of white rice on occasion, such as with other nourishing foods like pastured meats, bone broth, and vegetables. The healthy combination can balance out the negative effects of the lost nutrients in the bran and germ of the rice. I like to combine brown rice with cooked dried beans and vegetables, or serve organic white jasmine rice on occasion with meat and poultry&#x2014;sometimes brown rice feels too heavy to eat with meat, and white rice can be just the thing to accompany it.<br><br>Eating a diet of refined, processed foods over time can deplete the body of essential nutrients that it needs to function properly. However, eating something refined on an occasional basis shouldn&#x2019;t cause much harm if the body is well nourished from an otherwise whole foods diet. If you are currently eating a diet heavy in processed foods, though, start out with the easy swaps, like trading bread for brown rice, or fruit juice for an apple or orange; also, consider replacing one of your present meals a day with one of the recipes in this book. Over time, you&#x2019;ll gravitate to the whole foods and save the processed foods for occasional treats.<br><br>Healthy Whole Foods<br><br>Whole foods are naturally more calming and nourishing than processed foods. Why is this? It&#x2019;s because a whole food is something you can imagine growing or living in nature, like kale, chicken, eggs, fish, almonds, carrots, millet, olives, apples, strawberries, brown rice, or avocados. These foods have not been processed, enriched, or denatured in any way. They contain a perfect balance of nutrients&#x2014;just as nature intended. Basing your diet on whole foods, and using small amounts of minimally processed foods like olive and coconut oils, whole-grain gluten-free flours, and natural sweeteners, you&#x2019;ll most likely see a dramatic improvement in your and your children&#x2019;s overall health.<br><br>Eat a Plant-Rich Diet<br><br>A plant-rich diet is one that focuses on foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Animal foods, while very nutrient dense, make up a smaller proportion of your diet. Compared to all other food types, plants provide the body with the most gene-signaling molecules.<br><br>You&#x2019;ve heard the architectural expression, &#x201c;Form follows function.&#x201d; In nature, form equals function. Plants package themselves in their whole forms for brilliant reasons: the tougher outer portions are barriers against potential threats, such as sudden temperature changes, bacteria, fungi, or insects, and they contain important chemicals that act as natural antioxidants, microbial deterrents, and insecticides. It so happens that these very same plant chemicals offer numerous beneficial effects to the human body. Phenols, such as catechins, ellagic acid, and tannins, as well as pectin and other soluble fibers, are protective against forms of cancer, with some of these compounds even binding readily to heavy metals and radioactive particles from the environment, allowing for proper excretion from the body. When the exteriors of these plants are broken or stripped during processing, many of the protective compounds are lost. But when you base your diet on whole plant foods, you get an abundance of phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which signal your genes to keep the immune system calm and the body healthy.<br><br>The Importance of Organics<br><br>A review published in 2010 found organic foods to contain higher levels of vitamin C, iron, and magnesium, as well as more of the important antioxidant phytochemicals like carotenoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. The higher mineral level is logical, considering that organic farmers continuously add organic material to the soil to nurture the fruits, vegetables, and grains they grow, as well as the animals that eat those crops. If you talk with an organic farmer, you will quickly learn how important soil quality is for higher yields, better flavor, and insect and disease control. They all acknowledge that well-fed plants are naturally more resistant to disease and harmful insects.<br><br>Chemical Use Changes How Plants Behave<br><br>Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides that may persist in the soil and the environment for upward of 50 years. Not only do these chemicals get into the food we eat, but they also enter our water, air, and soil, harming the delicate balance of beneficial insects, aquatic life, soil microorganisms, and other living things that inhabit the farms. These chemicals can change the ability of those crops to interact well with the environment, including how they handle the soil microorganisms, harmful insects, competitive plants, and other natural stressors. These stressors are important because they force the plants to produce protective chemical compounds. Anytime you stress a plant, it forces that plant to defend itself and become &#x201c;stronger.&#x201d; For example, when the sun strikes a plant, with UV radiation, the plant will produce natural sunscreens like carotenoids and flavonoids. When insects nibble on the leaves of a broccoli plant, the plant can produce natural insecticides, such as the sulforaphane found in the cruciferous family of vegetables. If these same cruciferous vegetables are conventionally farmed and periodically sprayed with pesticides, they are not as likely to produce these natural substances.<br><br>The Impact of Chemical Farming<br><br>The chemical pesticides that farmers use are likely to negatively impact all who consume them, whether insect or human. And why wouldn&#x2019;t they? That is exactly what they are engineered to do. Research done in California found that the children of mothers living within 500 meters of commercial field sites using the highest levels of organochlorine pesticides had a 6.1 times higher risk of having autism. Numerous studies examining the pesticide exposure of neonates have determined that the negative impact on brain function and intelligence measures increases as pesticide levels rise. One study showed a lowering of IQ by seven points by the age of seven, in those with the highest exposures to pesticides.<br><br>Organic Is the Most Nourishing Choice<br><br>Children who eat a conventional diet are continually exposed to pesticides. One study examined the urinary levels in children of two commonly used agricultural pesticides&#x2014;malathion and chlorpyrifos. Measured before, during, and after the children ate a five-day organic diet, the study showed that pesticide levels were elevated before the organic diet, and again when the children returned to a conventional diet. During the organic diet, however, the urinary levels of these two pesticides were almost undetectable.<br><br>Clearly, buying and eating organic food are of utmost importance in decreasing the amount of chemicals we are exposed to&#x2014;not only for our children but also for everyone else, especially those living near commercial farms. Ideally, this diet change should begin before a child is even conceived, as the preconception time and the last two trimesters of pregnancy are the most vulnerable periods for chemical exposure. Remember: plants grown in nutrient-rich soil contain more vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals than their conventionally grown counterparts. These natural nutrients keep our bodies functioning properly, help us grow resilient children, and protect us all from disease.<br><br>Why Gluten-Free?<br><br>Food is made up of thousands of large molecules that need to be broken down into smaller molecules so they can be taken into the body and used for fuel&#x2014;as a facilitator of many reactions&#x2014;or is incorporated into cell structures. This process of digestion and absorption can be altered by numerous factors, one of which may be the food itself. And this food may be gluten. People react differently to the ingestion of gluten. For some, the reaction may be an IgE-mediated gluten allergy, while for others it is a tearing down of the intestinal lining otherwise known as celiac disease. Others can have adverse symptoms known broadly as a gluten sensitivity reaction. Though not everyone will experience these serious reactions, everyone is likely to have a gluten-initiated leaky gut after consuming gluten. It&#x2019;s important to note, of course, that people who are very healthy, have low stress levels, who have an optimal nutrient status (including good levels of vitamin D), and have well-functioning immune and digestive systems with a diverse population of beneficial microbes in their guts&#x2014;a healthy microbiome&#x2014;will experience fewer adverse effects after gluten consumption.<br><br>Some people with celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity can immediately feel the effects of eating something containing gluten, usually bloating and digestive upset; others may have &#x201c;silent&#x201d; symptoms that range from infertility to osteoporosis. For example, it is possible to have celiac disease but have no symptoms other than iron-deficiency anemia. There are just too many possible ways that gluten can cause harm. So even if you do not have a gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, your digestion and overall health may well benefit from a gluten-free diet.</p><h2>Entertaining at Home: Inspirations from Celebrated Hosts</h2><p><b><i>Entertaining at Home </i>presents gatherings in the homes of leading tastemakers from the worlds of interior design, architecture, culinary arts, and society--including Lynn Wyatt, Suzanne Kasler, Julia Reed, K</b><b>imberly Schlegel Whitman, Carla McDonald, and Danielle Rollins, among others--who show readers how best to entertain with flair and finesse.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Leading party aficionados share their successful strategies for delighting family and friends, offering their personal viewpoints and providing behind-the-scenes details that go into creating memorable occasions.

It offers daily reflections and prayers to help deepen the day-to-day faith life of every Catholic so that you can meet our Lord in a personal and real way. The goal of this book is to assist you in understanding the abundance of Mercy poured forth from the Heart of our Savior as it is revealed in the writings of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska. "Divine Mercy in My Soul: Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska" is soon to become a classic spiritual book that everyone is encouraged to read in their lifetime. However, many find this invitation intimidating, not just because of the width of her book, but because of the depth of its message on The Divine Mercy in each of Saint Faustina&#x2019;s notebook entries. This book, "Daily Reflections on Divine Mercy," was written with the hope of guiding you through Saint Faustina&#x2019;s Diary and her six notebooks of reflections. It can be used on its own to help you pause and reflect on the beauty of Jesus&#x2019; messages to her, or as a companion book, as you simultaneously read Saint Faustina&#x2019;s Diary. "Daily Reflections on Divine Mercy" offers 365 daily teachings, reflections and prayers based upon the pages of Saint Faustina&#x2019;s Diary. The structured way to use this daily reflection book is to do just that...reflect upon one page each day. However, some may feel called to skip around a bit, read a few reflections at a time, or return to a particular reflection through which God spoke to you. Therefore, though this book was written with the intent of providing one reflection for each day of the year, the best way to use it is any way you feel called and the way that benefits your relationship with God the most. The first paragraph for each day offers this author&#x2019;s insights to the words and teachings of Saint Faustina. The section of her Diary used for the day&#x2019;s teaching is marked so that the reader can also read her Diary first hand so as to see the primary source that the author of this book took inspiration from for that day&#x2019;s reflection. Though the primary text of the Diary is never quoted, nor are the reflections of this book exact representations of the Diary, they do provide the foundational basis for the spiritual message shared in each reflection. The second paragraph for each day offers a short reflection put more as a question to the reader. It offers the same insight in a different format so as to enter more deeply into the message of the day. Finally, each daily reflection ends with a prayer focused upon the message and reflection for that day. The reader is encouraged to pray this prayer several times. Ideally, it is prayed first thing in the morning, again during the day, and again at night as an examination on how well the daily message was received. As you seek to survive the world we live in, allow these pages to be a font of Mercy for you from God. Allow God&#x2019;s Divine Mercy to penetrate your heart so that you will know the abundance of His love and be more prepared to share that love with others.</p><p>&#34;John Paul Thomas&#34; is the pen name this priest picked in honor of the Apostles Saints John and Thomas and the great evangelist Saint Paul. This name also evokes the memory of the great Pope Saint John Paul II. John is the beloved Apostle who sought out a deeply personal and intimate relationship with his Savior. Hopefully the writings in this book point us all to a deeply personal and intimate relationship with our God. May John be a model of this intimacy and love. Thomas is also a beloved Apostle and close friend of Jesus but is well known for his lack of faith in Jesus&#39; resurrection. Though he ultimately entered into a profound faith crying out, &#34;my Lord and my God,&#34; he is given to us as a model of our own weakness of faith. Thomas should inspire us to always return to faith when we realize we have doubted. As a Pharisee, Paul severely persecuted the early Christian Church. However, after going through a powerful conversion, he went on to become the great evangelist to the gentiles, founding many new communities of believers and writing many letters contained in Sacred Scripture. His letters are deeply personal and reveal a shepherd&#39;s heart. He is a model for all as we seek to embrace our calling to spread the Gospel.</p><h2>Destination Earth: A New Philosophy of Travel by a World-Traveler</h2><p><b>Updated 2nd Edition 2019</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Gold Medal Winner: </b><b>International Book Award in the Travel Category, 2017</b><b>Gold Medal Winner: Independent Press Award in the Travel Category, 2017</b><b>Silver Medal Winner: Reader's Favorite Award in the Travel Genre, 2017</b> <br><i>"In his book, Destination Earth, Nicos Hadjicostis shares the ultimate 'budget travel tip': how to make your travels transformational." -</i> <b>Rick Steves</b>, Travel Writer and TV Presenter<br> <br><i>"An epic journey with a master philosopher." - </i><b>Daniel Klein</b>, New York Times best-selling author<br> <br><i>"I know a potential best seller when I see one.

There&#39;s a `just right&#39; quality to the verse that makes it a pleasure to read the words aloud. Their sounds fit together with seamless craftsmanship and their sense rewards listeners with humor, imagination, and occasional poignancy....Because it appeals on so many levels, this is one poetry book that won&#39;t siton the shelf for long.&#34;--Booklist.</p><p>"If you don't believe in dragons, / It is curiously true / That the dragons you disparage / Choose to not to believe in you," matter-of-factly claims America's premiere children's poet Jack Prelutsky. Dragons aren't all the same, of course--some are amiable, some are disconsolate, and some are downright nasty. Here Prelutsky, who has written over 30 books of poetry for children, turns his considerable talents to the subject of dragons--a secret dragon, a thunder dragon, a mechanical dragon, even a lazy dragon who likes to sleep all day. The 17 poems range from the whimsical to the scary, but all reflect Prelutsky's incomparable flair for rhythm and humor. The fabulous fire-breathers are illustrated in all their irresistible splendor by award-winning artist Peter Sis. The sophisticated style of his large oil paintings is complemented by his trademark borders in antique gold, giving the pages an Old World look.

In <i>Paddy Whacked</i>, bestselling author and organized crime expert T. J. English brings to life nearly two centuries of Irish American gangsterism, which spawned such unforgettable characters as Mike "King Mike" McDonald, Chicago's subterranean godfather; Big Bill Dwyer, New York's most notorious rumrunner during Prohibition; Mickey Featherstone, troubled Vietnam vet turned Westies gang leader; and James "Whitey" Bulger, the ruthless and untouchable Southie legend. Stretching from the earliest New York and New Orleans street wars through decades of bootlegging scams, union strikes, gang wars, and FBI investigations, <i>Paddy Whacked</i> is a riveting tour de force that restores the Irish American gangster to his rightful preeminent place in our criminal history - and penetrates to the heart of the American experience.</p></p><p><p>T. J. English is a noted journalist, a screenwriter, and the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Havana Nocturne</em>, <em>Paddy Whacked</em>, and <em>The Savage City</em>, as well as of <em>The Westies</em>, a national bestseller, and <em>Born to Kill</em>, which was nominated for an Edgar Award. He has written for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Playboy</em>, and <em>Esquire</em>, among other publications. His screenwriting credits include episodes of the television crime dramas <em>NYPD Blue</em> and <em>Homicide</em>, for which he was awarded the Humanitas Prize. He lives in New York City.</p>The American mob has long been seen as run by Italians and their henchmen. Edgar-nominee English (<i>Born to Kill</i>) sets the record straight, emphasizing that Irish ingenuity first established the mob in the U.S. Close to two million Irish inundated the American Northeast in the aftermath of the Irish famine of the 1840s. "[T]he formation of a gang," writes English, "carried with it the whiff of a noble gesture," and the Irish personality--full of resentment, rebellion, suspicion and clannishness--mixed with poverty proved to be perfect for this new way of life. Prohibition--the high point for the Irish mob in America--first was viewed by the Irish as a WASP attack on their way of life, and eventually as a way to get rich. But Prohibition was also the beginning of the end of super-Irish gangsters. English covers the bootlegging escapades of Joseph P. Kennedy and--number one on the FBI Most Wanted List--Boston's Whitey Bulger. But there are also colorful details about the likes of "Mad Dog" Coll, "Two Gun" Crowley and mayors Walker of New York and Curley of Boston. This is an intense, erudite yet sometimes horrifying account of violent Celtic criminals who make the Dead End Kids look like choirboys. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>Agent, Nat Sobel.

How could it lose? But instead Salamon got a front-row seat at the Hollywood disaster of the decade. She shadowed the film from its early stages through the last of the eviscerating reviews, and met everyone from the actors to the technicians to the studio executives. They'd all signed on for a blockbuster, but there was a sense of impending doom from the start--heart-of-gold characters replaced Wolfe's satiric creations; affable Tom Hanks was cast as the patrician heel; Melanie Griffith appeared mid-shoot with new, bigger breasts. With a keen eye and ear, Salamon shows us how the best of intentions turned into a legendary Hollywood debacle.<br><i>The Devil's Candy</i> joins John Gregory Dunne's <i>The Studio,</i> Steven Bach's <i>Final Cut,</i> and William Goldman's <i>Adventures in the Screen Trade</i> as a classic for anyone interested in the workings of Hollywood. With a new afterword profiling De Palma ten years after the movie's devastating flop (and this book's best-selling publication), Julie Salamon has created a riveting insider's portrait of an industry where art, talent, ego, and money combine and clash on a monumental scale.<br><b>"Delightful. <i>The Devil's Candy</i> is quite simply the most telling examination of moviemaking since Lillian Ross's [<i>Picture</i>]. . . . One must be thankful to the filmmakers for producing such a spectacle, if only so that this book could be written."--Graydon Carter, <i>Vogue</i></b><br></p><p><b>Julie Salamon</b> is a critic for the <i>New York Times</i> and the author of five books. She lives in New York City.Engaging, in-depth study of how Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities was transferred from megahit book to megaflop movie; by the film critic of The Wall Street Journal, novelist of White Lies (1987). With an okay from Brian de Palma, Bonfire's director, Salamon jumped on board early, when only Tom Hanks had been hired to play Sherman McCoy. She charts the movie's birth pains, financing, script revisions, casting, location-scouting in the Bronx and Manhattan, the New York shoot and the Los Angeles shoot, second unit work for backgrounds not directed by de Palma, editing, sound mixing, scoring, previews around L.A. and in Boston, reediting, advertising, premiere, and reviews. Salamon keeps a steady interest both in the artisans and the mechanics of their art without ever quite finding a voice of her own (say, like Pauline Kael's) or revealing how her presence on the scene may have affected anything. ``The devil's candy'' is a phrase from Peter Guber, the movie's original producer, which means both the actress to be cast as Sherman's mistress and the orgasm of instant success, as in E.T. or Batman. The book's embattled center is de Palma, who is rescued from his ghoulish image in suspense films, and would be the book's tragic hero were the abortive film a tragedy instead of a creative misfire from the first script and first compromise onward. Even so, this movie struck its makers as ``the definitive vehicle of dreams...the stretch limo of hopes and ambition.'' Stephen Spielberg's take on what happened is right on target: ``Brian is stepping into shoes that can be worn by other film makers. When he does that he's caught up in the machinery of the studio system.'' Like watching a World Trade Center tower topple onto Wall Street.

Against a backdrop of fires and tangled wrecks, bar fights and smelt feeds, <i>Population: 485</i> is a comic and sometimes heartbreaking true tale leavened with quieter meditations on an overlooked America. </p></p><p><p>Michael Perry is a humorist, radio host, songwriter, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of several nonfiction books, including <em>Visiting Tom</em> and <em>Population: 485</em>, as well as a novel, <em>The Jesus Cow</em>.

Saving homes and lives proved to be a noteworthy experience, thus providing direction in his own life. In a storyteller's tone, Perry describes how pulling victims from car wrecks, rescuing families from burning homes, and responding to numerous 911 calls regarding people (and animals and birds) in dire need went far beyond obligation. He describes how small-town life and volunteer work became part of a joyful and heart-wrenching reality that changed his life forever for the better.

As I crossed the long entrance hall of Monk&#x2019;s Piece on my way from the dining room, where we had just enjoyed the first of the happy, festive meals, toward the drawing room and the fire around which my family were now assembled, I paused and then, as I often do in the course of an evening, went to the front door, opened it and stepped outside.&nbsp; <br><br>I have always liked to take a breath of the evening, to smell the air, whether it is sweetly scented and balmy with the flowers of midsummer, pungent with the bonfires and leaf-mold of autumn, or crackling cold from frost and snow. I like to look about me at the sky above my head, whether there are moon and stars or utter blackness, and into the darkness ahead of me; I like to listen for the cries of nocturnal creatures and the moaning rise and fall of the wind, or the pattering of rain in the orchard trees, I enjoy the rush of air toward me up the hill from the flat pastures of the river valley.<br><br>Tonight, I smelled at once, and with a lightening heart, that there had been a change in the weather. All the previous week, we had had rain, chilling rain and a mist that lay low about the house and over the countryside. From the windows, the view stretched no farther than a yard or two down the garden. It was wretched weather, never seeming to come fully light, and raw, too. There had been no pleasure in walking, the visibility was too poor for any shooting and the dogs were permanently morose and muddy. Inside the house, the lamps were lit throughout the day and the walls of larder, outhouse and cellar oozed damp and smelled sour, the fires sputtered and smoked, burning dismally low.<br><br>My spirits have for many years now been excessively affected by the ways of the weather, and I confess that, had it not been for the air of cheerfulness and bustle that prevailed in the rest of the house, I should have been quite cast down in gloom and lethargy, unable to enjoy the flavor of life as I should like and irritated by my own susceptibility. But Esm� is merely stung by inclement weather into a spirited defiance, and so the preparations for our Christmas holiday had this year been more than usually extensive and vigorous.<br><br>I took a step or two out from under the shadow of the house so that I could see around me in the moonlight. Monk&#x2019;s Piece stands at the summit of land that rises gently up for some four hundred feet from where the little River Nee traces its winding way in a north to south direction across this fertile, and sheltered, part of the country. Below us are pastures, interspersed with small clumps of mixed, broadleaf woodland. But at our backs for several square miles it is a quite different area of rough scrub and heathland, a patch of wildness in the midst of well-farmed country. We are but two miles from a good-sized village, seven from the principal market town, yet there is an air of remoteness and isolation which makes us feel ourselves to be much further from civilization.<br><br>I first saw Monk&#x2019;s Piece one afternoon in high summer, when out driving in the trap with Mr. Bentley. Mr. Bentley was formerly my employer, but I had lately risen to become a full partner in the firm of lawyers to which I had been articled as a young man (and with whom, indeed, I remained for my entire working life). He was at this time nearing the age when he had begun to feel inclined to let slip the reins of responsibility, little by little, from his own hands into mine, though he continued to travel up to our chambers in London at least once a week, until he died in his eighty-second year. But he was becoming more and more of a country-dweller. He was no man for shooting and fishing but, instead, he had immersed himself in the roles of country magistrate and churchwarden, governor of this, that and the other county and parish board, body and committee. I had been both relieved and pleased when finally he took me into full partnership with himself, after so many years, while at the same time believing the position to be no more than my due, for I had done my fair share of the donkey work and borne a good deal of the burden of responsibility for directing the fortunes of the firm with, I felt, inadequate reward&#x2014;at least in terms of position.<br><br>So it came about that I was sitting beside Mr. Bentley on a Sunday afternoon, enjoying the view over the high hawthorn hedgerows across the green, drowsy countryside, as he let his pony take the road back, at a gentle pace, to his somewhat ugly and over-imposing manor house. It&nbsp; was rare for me to sit back and do nothing. In London I lived for my work, apart from some spare time spent in the study and collecting of watercolors. I was then thirty-five and I had been a widower for the past twelve years. I had no taste at all for social life and, although in good general health, was prone to occasional nervous illnesses and conditions, as a result of the experiences I will come to relate. Truth to tell, I was growing old well before my time, a somber, pale-complexioned man with a strained expression&#x2014;a dull dog.<br><br>I remarked to Mr. Bentley on the calm and sweetness of the day, and after a sideways glance in my direction he said, &#x201c;You should think of getting yourself something in this direction&#x2014;why not? Pretty little cottage&#x2014;down there, perhaps?&#x201d; And he pointed with his whip to where a tiny hamlet was tucked snugly into a bend of the river below, white walls basking in the afternoon sunshine. &#x201c;Bring yourself out of town some of these Friday afternoons, take to walking, fill yourself up with fresh air and good eggs and cream.&#x201d;<br><br>The idea had a charm, but only a distant one, seemingly unrelated to myself, and so I merely smiled and breathed in the warm scents of the grasses and the field flowers and watched the dust kicked up off the lane by the pony&#x2019;s hooves and thought no more about it. Until, that is, we reached a stretch of road leading past a long, perfectly proportioned stone house, set on a rise above a sweeping view down over the whole river valley and then for miles away to the violet-blue line of hills in the distance.<br><br>At that moment, I was seized by something I cannot precisely describe, an emotion, a desire&#x2014;no, it was rather more, a knowledge, a simple <i>certainty</i>, which gripped me, and all so clear and striking that I cried out involuntarily for Mr. Bentley to stop, and, almost before he had time to do so, climbed out of the pony trap into the lane and stood on a grassy knoll, gazing first up at the house, so handsome, so utterly right for the position it occupied, a modest house and yet sure of itself, and then looking across at the country beyond. I had no sense of having been here before, but an absolute conviction that I would come here again, that the house was already mine, bound to me invisibly.<br><br>To one side of it, a stream ran between the banks toward the meadow beyond, whence it made its meandering way down to the river.<br><br>Mr. Bentley was now looking at me curiously, from the trap. &#x201c;A fine place,&#x201d; he called.<br><br>I nodded, but, quite unable to impart to him any of my extreme emotions, turned my back upon him and walked a&nbsp; few yards up the slope from where I could see the entrance to the old, overgrown orchard that lay behind the house and petered out in long grass and tangled thicket at the far end. Beyond that, I glimpsed the perimeter of some rough-looking, open land. The feeling of conviction I have described was still upon me, and I remember that I was alarmed by it, for I had never been an imaginative or fanciful man and certainly not one given to visions of the future. Indeed, since those earlier experiences I had deliberately avoided all contemplation of any remotely nonmaterial matters, and clung to the prosaic, the visible and tangible.<br><br>Nevertheless, I was quite unable to escape the belief&#x2014;nay, I must call it more, the certain knowledge&#x2014;that this house was one day to be my own home, that sooner or later, though I had no idea when, I would become the owner of it. When finally I accepted and admitted this to myself, I felt on that instant a profound sense of peace and contentment settle upon me such as I had not known for very many years, and it was with a light heart that I returned to the pony trap, where Mr. Bentley was awaiting me more than a little curiously.<br><br>The overwhelming feeling I had experienced at Monk&#x2019;s Piece remained with me, albeit not in the forefront of my mind, when I left the country that afternoon to return to London. I had told Mr. Bentley that if ever he were to hear that the house was for sale, I should be eager to know of it.<br><br>Some years later, he did so. I contacted the agents that same day and hours later, without so much as returning to see it again, I had offered for it, and my offer was accepted. A few months prior to this, I had met Esm� Ainley. Our affection for one another had been increasing steadily, but, cursed as I still was by my indecisive nature in all personal and emotional matters, I had remained silent as to my intentions for the future. I had enough sense to take the news about Monk&#x2019;s Piece as a good omen, however, and a week after I had formally become the owner of the house, traveled into the country with Esm� and proposed marriage to her among the trees of the old orchard. This offer, too, was accepted and very shortly afterward we were married and moved at once to Monk&#x2019;s Piece. On that day, I truly believed that I had at last come out from under the long shadow cast by the events of the past and saw from his face and felt from the warmth of his handclasp that Mr. Bentley believed it too, and that a burden had been lifted from his own shoulders. He had always blamed himself, at least in part, for what had happened to me&#x2014;it had, after all, been he who had sent me on that first journey up to Crythin Gifford, and Eel Marsh House, and to the funeral of Mrs. Drablow.<br><br>But all of that could not have been further from my conscious thought at least, as I stood taking in the night air at the door of my house, on that Christmas Eve. For some fourteen years now Monk&#x2019;s Piece had been the happiest of homes&#x2014;Esm�&#x2019;s and mine, and that of her four children by her first marriage, to Captain Ainley. In the early days I had come here only at weekends and holidays but London life and business began to irk me from the day I bought the place and I was glad indeed to retire permanently into the country at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>And, now, it was to this happy home that my family had once again repaired for Christmas. In a moment, I should open the front door and hear the sound of their voices from the drawing room&#x2014;unless I was abruptly summoned by my wife, fussing about my catching a chill. Certainly, it was very cold and clear at last. The sky was pricked over with stars and the full moon rimmed with a halo of frost. The dampness and fogs of the past week had stolen away like thieves into the night, the paths and the stone walls of the house gleamed palely and my breath smoked on the air.<br><br>Upstairs, in the attic bedrooms, Isobel&#x2019;s three young sons&#x2014;Esm�&#x2019;s grandsons&#x2014;slept, with stockings tied to their bedposts. There would be no snow for them on the morrow, but Christmas Day would at least wear a bright and cheerful countenance.<br><br>There was something in the air that night, something, I suppose, remembered from my own childhood, together with an infection caught from the little boys, that excited me, old as I was. That my peace of mind was about to be disturbed, and memories awakened that I had thought forever dead, I had, naturally, no idea. That I should ever again renew my close acquaintance, if only in the course of vivid recollections and dreams, with mortal dread and terror of spirit, would have seemed at that moment impossible.<br><br>I took one last look at the frosty darkness, sighed contentedly, called to the dogs, and went in, anticipating nothing more than a pipe and a glass of good malt whisky beside the crackling fire, in the happy company of my family. As I crossed the hall and entered the drawing room, I felt an uprush of well-being, of the kind I have experienced regularly during my life at Monk&#x2019;s Piece, a sensation that leads on naturally to another, of heartfelt thankfulness. And indeed I did give thanks, at the sight of my family ensconced around the huge fire which Oliver was at that moment building to a perilous height and a fierce blaze with the addition of a further great branch of applewood from an old tree we had felled in the orchard the previous autumn. Oliver is the eldest of Esm�&#x2019;s sons, and bore then, as now, a close resemblance both to his sister Isobel (seated beside her husband, the bearded Aubrey Pearce) and to the brother next in age, Will. All three of them have good, plain, open English faces, inclined to roundness and with hair and eyebrows and lashes of a light chestnut brown&#x2014;the color of their mother&#x2019;s hair before it became threaded with gray.<br><br>At that time, Isobel was only twenty-four years old but already the mother of three young sons, and set fair to produce more. She had the plump, settled air of a matron and an inclination to mother and oversee her husband and brothers as well as her own children. She had been the most sensible, responsible of daughters, she was affectionate and charming, and she seemed to have found, in the calm and level-headed Aubrey Pearce, an ideal partner. Yet at times I caught Esm� looking at her wistfully, and she had more than once voiced, though gently and to me alone, a longing for Isobel to be a little less staid, a little more spirited, even frivolous.<br><br>In all honesty, I could not have wished it so. I would not have wished for anything to ruffle the surface of that calm, untroubled sea.</p><h2>Advancing Differentiation: Thinking and Learning for the 21st Century (Free Spirit Professional&#x2122;)</h2><p><b>Powerful strategies that will transform the way you teach and the way your students learn.</b><br><br><i>Advancing Differentiation</i> will lead you through the process of creating a thriving, student-centered, 21st-century classroom.

It blends family cohesion (mom and grandpa both take time telling stories and helping teach Art to fly fish), subtle contexts of fly fishing, and a gentle message of conservation. It's certainly a children's book for the fly fishing family to enjoy and connect through the off-season, but it's also a book for non-fly fishing friends to share with their kids...If I were a youngster again, this is exactly the kind of book that I would have lost myself into..."<br><br><i>Dun Magazine</i>: "A heartwarming picture book about fishing and family...<b>Down By the River</b> is a celebration of the power of the sport to draw families together and back to cherished natural places."<br><br><i>Ontario Outdoors</i>: "Where were children's books like Andrew Weiner's <b>Down By the River</b> when my daughters were young&nbsp; and my wife and I would read to them at bed time?

She writes about kitchen gardening and seasonal cooking on her popular blog, DigginFood.com, and pens the weekly column, "The Gardener," on Apartment Therapy's Re-Nest blog. Each Tuesday morning, Willi offers vegetable gardening advice on Seattle's popular NPR call-in show, <i>Greendays</i>. She also teaches a joint gardening and cooking class with James Beard award-nominated chef Matthew Dillon at the Corson Building in Seattle and hosts an online garden-to-table cooking show, <i>Grow. Cook. Eat.</i>, with her husband, Jon. Willi was the West Coast Editor of <i>Organic Gardening</i> magazine from 2003 to 2010. The author lives in Portland, OR.For those fortunate enough to have a plot of arable land, what can be more rewarding and satisfying than creating a vegetable garden? It may be just adequate enough to raise a few greens for a summer salad, or it may offer acreage sufficient to sow rows of corn or establish a raspberry patch. Gardener Galloway encourages even urban dwellers to consider raising their own fruits and vegetables. In this guide, she offers instructions on basic preparation of growing beds, including composting, an essential step for her preferred method of organic agriculture. For every potential garden product, Galloway describes its characteristics, preferred varieties, and best propagation methods from seed to harvest. She inventories commonly available greens, herbs, squashes, tubers, cabbages, and fruits. For each crop, she offers a recipe, virtually all vegetarian save for a classic grilled leg of lamb with fragrant rosemary. Color photographs accentuate the most appealing qualities of both produce and finished dishes.<br><i><b>Booklist<br></b></i><br>Sustainable gardening and eating locally are popular now, and this is one of a number of new books for kitchen gardeners. Master gardener and radio commentator Galloway (former West Coast editor,&nbsp;<i>Organic Gardening</i>&nbsp;) concentrates here on herbs, greens, legumes, squash, cabbage, roots, tubers and bulbs, warm-season vegetables, and fruits, giving hints on planning a garden, using good soil, planting, watering, fertilizing, weeding, and dealing with insects and diseases. Chapters describe individual crops and suggest the best way to plant, grow, harvest, store, and cook them. Galloway recommends particular varieties and notes botanical and family names, edible parts, and problems in growing. For each kind of produce, she also provides a recipe that is simple and easy to prepare. Some are unusual, such as Tartines with Gruy�re and Radish Greens, Roasted Beets with Winter Citrus Vinaigrette, and Cucumber Wedges with Chile and Lime. Full-page color photographs accompany many of the recipes and produce descriptions.&nbsp;VERDICT&nbsp;This book is recommended for all readers interested in eating what they grow.<br><i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br>Galloway's enthusiasm and expertise inform every page of her first book. Don't be fooled by the elegant design; this isn't a book about landscaping with edibles. It's a down-to-earth look at how to organically and successfully grow your dinner. What makes this book stand out from the hundreds of other new vegetable-gardening books? It's Galloway's recommendations for varieties that thrive here, from blueberries to basil. And her eclectic recipes ensure that "Grow Cook Eat" won't languish on the book shelf. You'll have it out on the kitchen counter to try Shaved Summer Squash with Pecorino Romano, maybe with Raspberry-Infused Vodka Spritzers.<br><b>Valerie Easton,<i> The Seattle Times</i></b><br><br>Like to eat as much as you like to garden?

Dean Oliver highlights general strategies for teams when they&#x2019;re winning or losing and what aspects should be the focus in either situation. He describes and quantifies the jobs of team leaders and role players, then discusses the interactions between players and how to achieve the best fit. Oliver conceptualizes the meaning of teamwork and how to quantify the value of different types of players working together. He examines historically successful NBA teams and identifies what made them so successful: individual talent, a system of putting players together, or good coaching. Oliver then uses these statistical tools and case studies to evaluate the best players in history, such as Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Charles Barkley and how they contributed to their teams&#x2019; success. He does the same for some of the NBA&#x2019;s "oddball" players-Manute Bol, Muggsy Bogues, and Dennis Rodman and for the WNBA&#x2019;s top players. <i>Basketball on Paper</i> is unique in its incorporation of business and analytical concepts within the context of basketball to measure the value of players in a cooperative setting. Whether you&#x2019;re looking for strategies or new ideas to throw out while watching the ballgame at a sports bar, Dean Oliver&#x2019;s<i>Basketball on Paper</i> will give you amazing new insights into teamwork, coaching, and success.</p><p>Basketball stats and strategy for coaches and fans alike.Dean Oliver is a former basketball player, assistant coach, and collegiate scout, and has contributed to Basketball Digest.

This book is written explicitly for clinicians, who will find the clearly written, practical guidance invaluable. Of particular interest are the authoritative description of the psychopathology of eating disorders and the lucid analysis of the management and treatment of underweight patients and those with multiple comorbidities. This is the definitive clinical account of CBT for eating disorders."--G. Terence Wilson, PhD, Oscar K. Buros Professor of Psychology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</p><p>"Over the past 30 years, Fairburn has made immense contributions to our understanding and treatment of patients with eating disorders. This timely, clearly written, immensely informative, and very user-friendly book provides just what the clinician needs--a practical guide to all phases of treatment. Outlining his transdiagnostic model, Fairburn describes the processes that underlie all eating disorders and gives specific examples of how to assess, educate, and help patients with any eating disorder. Treatment is divided into stages, with clear guidelines for exactly what to say or do. This book will quickly become the preferred clinical guide in the eating disorders field.

The book is remarkably easy to read&#x2015;each concept is clearly illustrated and the book's figures, charts, and diagrams further illuminate the text. Examples included in the text, such as common patient questions, vignettes, and sample therapist responses, help make the concepts and explanations presented in this guide easy to grasp. Perhaps most importantly, this book provides valuable insight into the treatment of a challenging clinical population....The ideas presented in this book are provocative, questioning the conventional classification of eating disorders and offering a treatment based on a transdiagnostic approach. The publication of this book is quite timely as the eating disorders field ponders the most meaningful way to revise the diagnostic categories for the upcoming edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, DSM-5....Useful to both novice and more experienced clinicians. It would perhaps be most helpful for clinicians familiar with CBT who work with patients with eating disorders. Psychiatry residents or graduate students in areas such as psychology or social work who are working with patients with eating disorders would also find this a very useful guide....An interesting addition to the literature on the treatment of patients with eating disorders.

The most widely accepted form of evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for these illnesses is based on his protocols. His view that eating disorders are 'transdiagnostic,' that is, that they have core symptoms in common that can be treated with one approach, forms the basis of his new book. It is a long-anticipated guide to his enhanced model of treatment....The author describes an extended version of the treatment for patients with problems with clinical perfectionism, core low self-esteem, and interpersonal difficulties. His assessment instruments, used by most researchers in the eating disorders field, are also available in the appendices. This text is simply essential reading for anyone treating eating disorders. The book reads like a series of authoritative lectures, complete with forms, case examples, and useful tables.

He served as a bridge between past and present&#x2014;between the ancient traditional craft and the development of origami as a contemporary practice&#x2014;inventing new techniques and in preserving the traditional Japanese forms. In fact, the notational system of diagrams widely used today to indicate how models are folded was developed mainly by him. Above all, Yoshizawa was responsible for elevating origami to the status of an art form. <br><br>This beautiful origami book is the first comprehensive survey of the extraordinary work of Akira Yoshizawa. In addition to 60 models from his private collection, it features over 1,000 original drawings by the artist, and English translations of his writings in Japanese on origami, all of which are published here for the very first time. <br><br><b>Origami projects include:</b> <ul><li> The Koinobori and the Helmet</li><li> Butterflies of Every Kind</li><li> Fairy Tale Crowns and Caps</li><li> The Lion Mask</li><li> The Tengu Masks</li><li> and much more!</li></ul><i>Akira Yoshizawa</i> also contains an explanation of the Master's personal philosophy of origami by Yoshizawa's widow, Kiyo Yoshizawa and an insightful introduction from Robert Lang, a leading artist and exponent of origami art in the West.</p><p>Born in 1911, <b>Akira Yoshizawa</b> is the father of modern origami. The publication of his first collection of models in the early 1950s caused a major sensation. In 1954, he founded the International Origami Centre in Tokyo. In 1955, his original works were exhibited for the first time at a show in Amsterdam, an enormously successful event that introduced him to the West. It was during these years that he came up with a system of notation based on a series of symbols and graphic signs indicating various types of folds and thus created a method that was later adopted by many origami artists and is still in use today. In subsequent decades Yoshizawa folded and taught origami, published books on the art, and participated in innumerable events on an international scale. As his fame spread throughout the world, he came to be seen as the most distinguished representative of the art, a pioneer of many techniques used in modern origami. Yoshizawa died in 2005, on the day of his 94th birthday. <br><br>Preface:<br><b>Kiyo Yoshizawa</b> married the Master in 1956 and became his manager from that point on. After her husband's death, she worked on preserving and disseminating his legacy throughout the world, directing and supporting the International Origami Centre with her constant activity, and passing down the artist's original techniques, including wetfolding, one of his inventions. In recent years, she has organized various exhibitions abroad to help the broad public understand Yoshizawa's works even better. <br><br>Introduction: <br>Born in 1961, <b>Robert J. Lang</b> has been deeply involved in origami since the age of six, when he discovered several instructions for traditional designs in a library book. This early beginning ignited a lifelong passion for the art. He is now considered one of the leading origami artists in the world, with hundreds of original creations to his credit, as well as 14 books authored, co-authored, or edited on the art, numerous articles and instructions published in origami periodicals, and he regularly lectures and teaches origami at conventions and workshops around the world. He has a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Caltech, and has used his mathematical and engineering training to advance origami, both artistically and in its applications to science and technology. In his origami career, he has drawn from many sources and influences, not least of which is the work of Yoshizawa-sensei. Yoshizawa's techniques, both technical and artistic, played a major role in Lang's own origami evolution, and he is honored to be able to contribute to this work of the master. <br><br>Photographer: <br>Born in 1958 in the prefecture of Chiba, <b>Kazuo Hamada</b> graduated from the Tokyo School of Photography and began freelancing in 1984. In 1990 he founded his own photography studio, and today he collaborates with Tokyo's prestigious Pacific Press Photo Agency. He has won the 21st Japan's Advertising Photographers' Association Award (APA) and other important prizes. His works have been exhibited in many photography exhibitions in Japan and abroad."Paper artists interested in reproducing masterworks of origami and learning techniques from an expert will be drawn to this lovely retrospective." &#x2014;<b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>"As I fold, Yoshizawa Sensei is telling me 'Too much detail, let the paper express the essence.' He is trying to let me hear the silence in my creations. I can only dream of succeeding like he did." &#x2014;<b>Bernie Peyton, author of <i>Eco-Origami</i> and curator of Origami Universe</b><br><br>"Akira Yoshizawa is known as the 'Grandfather of Origami' and with good cause. His revolutionary work set the foundations for modern origami and his quest to capture the true essence of the subject has led to a far deeper understanding of what is truly important about origami. His models are not highly technical, but even expert folders find it almost impossible to capture the subject as well as the Master. His influence on origami cannot be overstated and he is revered by the creative giants of the paper-folding world who have followed in his footsteps." &#x2014;<b>Nick Robinson, professional artist and author of many best-selling books on origami</b><br><br>"If you buy just one origami book this year, buy this one. Yoshizawa-sensei's work stands unchallenged at the pinnacle of origami achievement and this new collection should be required reading for any student of the art." &#x2014;<b>Paul Jackson: origami artist, author</b><br><br>"Akira Yoshizawa is the father of the modern art of origami.

A straightforward beginning to a carol that grows increasingly complicated as both the list of presents and the numbers involved accumulate. Brett's lavish treatment of the song portrays various levels of meaning; she has illustrated the fantastic gifts in outrageous splendor (seven swans swim in folkloric Russian headdresses), turned them into a border of tree decorations, included a menagerie of animals carrying banners with "Merry Christmas" in different languages, and set into the outer edges of each page an ongoing story about a family's preparations for the big day itself. In the final frame, the decorated tree serves as the centerpiece for their own caroling. The artist demonstrates, once again, that she will not relinquish a project before every last glorious detail is in place; the clarity of her vision is stunning. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Little Elephant Who Wants to Fall Asleep: A New Way of Getting Children to Sleep</h2><p><b>Add variety to your child&#x2019;s bedtime routine with the latest book from the author of <i>The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and international bestseller&nbsp;that parents have been raving about!&nbsp;Features all-new child-tested, parent-approved techniques to reclaim bedtime and provide a sweet and tender end to each day.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Your child joins Ellen the Elephant on a journey through a magical forest that leads to sleep.

She lives in Los Angeles.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;From the author of The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep, this is the second book in a series that is said to have a "sleep-promoting" effect on children (and adults). Ellen the Elephant takes readers on a long journey through a magical and "sleepy" forest while introducing a host of drowsy characters along the way. The story line is choppy, and all of the character interactions revolve around the end goal of sleep for this tired elephant. The illustrations are unexceptional and do little to enhance the narrative. The book begins with instructions to readers and explains when text should be emphasized and when it should be read in a more soothing tone. The prose is also marked with specific breaks where readers are prompted to yawn in order to induce sleep. A Q&amp;A section in the back urges readers to adapt the title to fit the needs of each child. VERDICT Instructional in nature, this selection will interest parents who are desperate to get their little ones to sleep. However, any classic bedtime story will do a better job of creating that special bedtime bonding experience.&#x2014;Kristen Todd-Wurm, Middle Country Public Library, NY</p><h2>Grow the Best Blueberries: Storey&#39;s Country Wisdom Bulletin A-89 (Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin)</h2><p>Since 1973, Storey&#39;s Country Wisdom Bulletins have offered practical, hands-on instructions designed to help readers master dozens of country living skills quickly and easily.

Little-known even to Italians outside the nefarious activities of its <i>'Ndrangheta</i> mafia organization, Calabria allures with its simplicity and rewards with an underlying complexity, as in savoring an artisanal cheese, appreciating an ancient Greek masterwork or interpreting a particularly expressive phrase in the local dialect. <i>Calabria: The Other Italy</i> paints a compelling picture of contemporary Calabria and Southern Italy, weaving observation, personal anecdote, salient historical information and social commentary into a nonfiction narrative that combines travelogue with an exploration of everyday life and culture. At times humorous, at others poignant, this engaging work portrays the joys and challenges of the "other Italy."</p><p>After numerous visits to Italy, Haid found herself increasingly enamored with the country, so she decided to move to Locri, Calabria, to teach English and fully immerse herself in Italian culture. Haid's book recounts her four-year stint in Calabria with an intoxicating blend of humor, joy, and reverence for this area in Italy's deep south. The book reads like a travelogue, with long descriptions of train rides and encounters, but it also serves as a travel guide, with many facts and figures integrated into the narrative. Haid does not shy away from mentioning the negatives of Calabrian culture. Much of these are approached with humor, with the exception of the more disturbing aspects of the local community, such as the power of omert� (the code or conspiracy silence that protects outlaws) and the influence of the Calabrian mafia over local politics and other community affairs. The chapters about criminal activity are broken up into two sections and separated by other chapters, and this deft organization preserves the predominantly upbeat and inspiring mood of tour into a lesser-known part of Italy. <b>PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY (BookLife)</b><br><br><i>Calabria: The Other Italy</i>&nbsp;is part history, part travel guide, part memoir -- and as informed and informative as it is engaging and entertaining, making it very highly recommended for community and academic library collections, as well as the personal reading lists for non-specialist general readers with an interest in this inherently fascinating provincial section of Italy. <b>MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW (Bookwatch) </b><br><br>In a charming and refreshingly honest recounting of her time spent teaching English in Italy, Karen Haid's&nbsp;<i>Calabria: The Other Italy</i>&nbsp;offers what many other books on Italy don't: an unfiltered portrayal of an American adjusting to life in the sometimes quirky, loud and beautiful regions of southern Italy.<br>The story of a newcomer in a small, Italian town is not an original one. But Haid's description of the town of Locri, her experiences teaching the local Italians, and her struggles with the Italian postal service feel fresh.<br>Even more intriguing is the region where Haid decides to live. Much&nbsp; has been written about Italy from the streets of Florence, Venice and Rome. Few venture to the toe of Italy's boot, where Calabria lies often forgotten despite its stunning coastlines and eccentric people. Haid offers the perfect combination of personal experiences with Calabrians, and the history and culture of the region. Admirably,&nbsp; she avoids romanticized depictions, presenting Calabria in all of its gritty, chaotic glory-which only adds to the beauty of her storytelling.&nbsp;<b>AMBASSADOR - Magazine of the National Italian American Foundation,&nbsp;Danielle DeSimone</b><br><br><i>Calabria: The Other Italy</i>&nbsp;is a phenomenal book that captures the heart and soul of one of Italy's most obscure and attractive regions. PRIMO enthusiastically recommends the book to all Italian Americans and those who have a passion for Italy. <b>PRIMO Italian American Magazine</b><br><br>This book combines a personal memoir with a travel guide, as the author interweaves her own experiences and observations with information on Calabria's history and points of interest.... If your family originated in Calabria, this book&nbsp;will make you proud of the region's rich history and its tough, much-put-upon people. <b>FRA NOI - BOSTONIANA</b></p><h2>A Good Walk Spoiled: Days and Nights on the PGA Tour</h2><p>In the highly acclaimed bestseller A Good Walk Spoiled, John Feinstein captures the world of professional golf as it has never been captured before. Traveling with the golfers on the PGA Tour, Feinstein gets inside the heads of the game&#39;s greatest players as well as its struggling wannabes. Meet superstars like Nick Price, who nailed a fifty-foot putt at the seventeenth to win the British Open, and Paul Azinger, who marked his return from a bout with cancer with an emotional appearance at the Buick Open. Go behind the scenes for Davis Love III&#39;s unforgettable come-from-behind victory in the Ryder Cup. In golf, Feinstein eloquently relates, the line that separates triumph from disappointment is incredibly fine. &#34;One week you&#39;ve discovered the secret to the game; the next week you never want to play it again&#34;.</p><p>On those magnificent days on which your drives split the fairway down the middle and your wedge shots leave you putting for birdie, you think: "I wonder if I could do this for a living." After all, guys in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, guys no one heard of until recently, are making planeloads of money on the various golf tours (and buying private planes to take them from one big-money tournament to the next). <i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> is a bit of a reality check. John Feinstein chronicles the struggles of the top golfers in the game, as well as those trying to get onto the PGA Tour. These are gifted players who've devoted their lives to the game, and on any given day they could just flat out stink. <i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> is a completely engaging book from first page to last, a wonderfully observed and masterfully told story of pain and profit in the world's most frustrating sport.John Feinstein is an American sportswriter and commentator. He is a columnist for the Washington Post, an author, is a guest commentator on NPR, and does color commentary for United States Naval Academy football games. He is also a frequent contributor to The Tony Kornheiser Show. During a radio broadcast of the football game between the Naval Academy and Duke University on October 1, 2005, Feinstein blurted an obscenity over-the-air in response to what he perceived to be a bad call on the field. He immediately removed himself from the rest of the broadcast, except to return at the end to apologize on the air. Although he offered his resignation to the Naval Academy, they rejected it because of his contrition and have invited him to continue to participate in future broadcasts. Feinstein was a sports writer for the The Chronicle while enrolled at Duke University, where he graduated in 1977. One of Feinstein&#39;s nicknames is &#34;Junior&#34;, despite not having the suffix in his name. The name was given by Tony Kornheiser because of the similarities in his temper to John McEnroe. Feinstein sometimes fills in as a guest host on The Jim Rome Show. Rome considers Feinstein to be one of the most intelligent people he&#39;s interviewed on the show, and occasionally teases him about an over-the-phone interview that was interrupted by Feinstein&#39;s daughter.</p><h2>A Treasury of Christmas Miracles: True Stories of God&#39;s Presence Today (Miracle Books Collection)</h2><p><b>#1<i> New York Times</i><i> </i>bestselling<i> </i>author Karen Kingsbury's classic collection of true stories that celebrates the wonder of Christmas is now available with an updated cover. </b>An incredible chance encounter that changes everything...help that suddenly appears from nowhere...kindness handed to us when it is least expected. We have all experienced miracles in our lives. In A TREASURY OF CHRISTMAS MIRACLES, Karen Kingsbury presents a collection of real-life stories about people whose lives were changed by the mystery of Christmas. With an uplifting voice, she shares undeniable proof of God's presence in our lives and gives us a joyous reminder of the true meaning of Christmas: the greatest miracle of all is opening our hearts to love.</p><p>KAREN KINGSBURY is a #1 <i>New York Times</i>bestselling author of more than 60 works of fiction and nonfiction with nearly 25 million copies in print. Widely considered America's favorite inspirational novelist, she is best known for drawing unforgettable characters and stories that evoke a range of emotions. Karen reaches over 100,000 women annually through national speaking appearances. She and her husband, Don, currently reside in Nashville, TN. <br>Bestselling CBA novelist Kingsbury combines her talents in fiction and journalism to recount these true stories of Christmas miracles, which she has reworked and fictionalized slightly. The stories all reflect, to some degree, God's intervention during the Christmas season to demonstrate his love: a small plane flying in treacherous conditions is able, miraculously, to land safely; a young missionary is healed of a potentially crippling disease. Some of the stories particularly "Jessica's Gift" could benefit from a softer, less didactic message, but others manage to be inspirational without all of the emotional Sturm und Drang. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Courage To Change: The Christian Roots of the Twelve-Step Movement</h2><p>The writings of the Reverend Sam Shoemaker, Episcopal minister, are examined in this volume in the light of their contribution to the principles of Twelve Step recovery.<br><br>Courage to Change deals with the influence of Sam Shoemaker on the early years of Alcoholics Anonymous, the writing of the Twelve Steps, and the book Alcoholics Anonymous. Bill Wilson proclaimed at the 1955 International AA Convention, "The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgment of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker." The writings of the Reverend Sam Shoemaker, Episcopal minister, are examined in this volume in the light of their contribution to the principles of Twelve Step recovery.</p><p>Bill holds advanced degrees in applied sociology and archival methods. Having worked in this field for over twenty years, he has also authored 15 books on the history of AA and 12-step recovery. He worked at the headquarters of Alcoholics Anonymous for five years. Bill&#39;s primary interest is the founding period of AA and the writing of their text in 1939.</p><h2>The Enneagram, Relationships, and Intimacy: Understanding One Another Leads to Loving Better and Living More Fully</h2><p><p>There are lots of books out there written about love. Some great ones discuss the importance of early secure attachment, and plenty too have been written about relationships and how to make them better. This book is a bit different. On behalf of David N. Daniels, M.D., Clinical Professor Emeritus Stanford Medical School, Suzanne Dion brings their shared personal passion for human development to the table alongside Daniel J. Siegel, M.D.'s groundbreaking study of "mindful awareness," David's over 40 years of study as a private-practice psychiatrist (working primarily with couples), 30 years spent developing and teaching the Enneagram and becoming world-renowned for having adapted the Enneagram to relationships, a 61-year marriage, and a deep and comprehensive understanding of human temperament and personality proclivities. Thanks to having studied something called, &#x201c;the Enneagram,&#x201d; David says, "...of all of the treatment modalities I worked with and tried out across my therapeutic career, nothing came close to helping couples heal their hearts, deconstruct their defenses, and open receptively as much as I witnessed happening when using a comprehensive application of the Enneagram system.&#x201d; Understanding ourselves as well as others &#x2014; with acceptance, discernment, curiosity, and wonderment &#x2014; in the way the Enneagram precipitates, provides the greatest foundation from which to build healthier, more receptive and more fulfilling relationships. It is our fundamental relationships that sustain our lives, fuel our happiness, and support our greater development and potential. </p><p>Bringing this book to fruition was the passionate focus of much of David's time, exploration, and thought the last many years of his life and was an honor for Suzanne to see through to completion.

But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig&#x2019;s life was more complicated&#x2014;and, perhaps, even more heroic&#x2014;than anyone really knew.<br> <br>Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, <i>Luckiest Man</i> gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig&#x2019;s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig&#x2019;s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous &#x201c;luckiest man&#x201d; speech.<br> <br>Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig&#x2019;s <i>Luckiest Man</i> shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we&#x2019;ve never seen him before.</p><p>Lou Gehrig started his professional baseball career at a time when players began to be seen as national celebrities. Though this suited charismatic men such as Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio, Gehrig avoided the spotlight and preferred to speak with his bat. Best known for playing in 2,130 consecutive games as well as his courage in battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a disease that now bears his name), the Iron Horse that emerges from this book is surprisingly na�ve and insecure. He would cry in the clubhouse after disappointing performances, was painfully shy around women (much to the amusement of some of his teammates), and particularly devoted to his German-immigrant mother all his life. Even after earning the league MVP award he still feared the Yankees would let him go. Against the advice of Ruth and others, he refused to negotiate aggressively and so earned less than he deserved for many seasons. Honest, humble, and notoriously frugal, his only vices were chewing gum and the occasional cigarette. And despite becoming one of the finest first basemen of all time, Jonathan Eig shows how Gehrig never seemed to conquer his self-doubt, only to manage it better. <p> Jonathan Eig's <i>Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig</i> offers a fascinating and well-rounded portrait of Gehrig, from his dugout rituals and historic games to his relationships with his mother, wife, coaches, and teammates. His complex friendship with Ruth, who was the polar opposite to Gehrig in nearly every respect, is given particularly vivid attention. Take this revealing description of how the two men began a barnstorming tour together following their 1927 World Series victory: "Ruth tipped the call girls and sent them on their way. Gehrig kissed his mother goodbye." Eig also shares some previously unknown details regarding his consecutive games streak and how he dealt with ALS during the final years of his life. Rich in anecdotes and based on hundreds of interviews and 200 pages of recently discovered letters, the book effectively shows why the Iron Horse remains an American icon to this day. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Jonathan Eig is a former senior special writer for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.

But some ambitions refuse to die, and as the years passed and the memories of slices and hooks faded, it dawned on Carl that there might be one thing in life he could do better in middle age than he could as a youth. So gradually he ventured back to the rolling, frustrating green hills of the golf course, where he ultimately&#x2014;and foolishly&#x2014;agreed to compete in a country-club tournament against players who can actually hit the ball.</p></p><p><p><b>CARL HIAASEN </b>was born and raised in Florida.

At my best, I&#x2019;d shown occasional flashes of competence. At my worst, I&#x2019;d been a menace to all carbon-based life-forms on the golf course.On the day I gave up golfing, I stood six-feet even, weighed a stringy 145 pounds and was in relatively sound physical shape. When I returned to the game, I was half an inch taller, twenty-one pounds heavier and nagged by the following age-related ailments:� elevated cholesterol; � a bone spur deep in the right rotator cuff; � an aching right hip; � a permanently weakened right knee, due to a badly torn medial meniscus that was scraped and repaired in February 2003 by the same orthopedic surgeon who&#x2019;d once worked on a young professional quarterback named Dan Marino. (The doctor had assured me that my injury was no worse than Marino&#x2019;s, then he&#x2019;d added with a hearty chuckle, &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re also not twenty-two years old.&#x201d;)Other factors besides my knee joint and HDL had changed during my long absence. When I&#x2019;d abandoned golf in 1973, I had been a happily married father of a two-year-old son. When I returned to the sport in 2005, I was a happily remarried father of a five-year-old son, a fourteen-year-old stepson and a thirty-four-year-old son with three kids of his own. In other words, I was a grandpa.Over those three busy and productive decades, a normal, well-centered person would have mellowed in the loving glow of the family hearth. Not me. I was just as restless, consumed, unreflective, fatalistic and emotionally unequipped to play golf in my fifties as I was in my teens.What possesses a man to return in midlife to a game at which he&#x2019;d never excelled in his prime, and which in fact had dealt him mostly failure, angst and exasperation?Here&#x2019;s why I did it: I&#x2019;m one sick bastard.The Last WaltzMy first taste of golf was as a shag caddy for my father. He often practiced hitting wedges in our front yard, and I&#x2019;d put on my baseball glove and play outfield.Dad seemed genuinely happy when I finally asked to take golf lessons. I was perhaps eleven or twelve, too young to realize that my disposition was ill-suited to a recreation that requires infinite patience and eternal optimism.The club pro was Harold Perry, a pleasant fellow and a solid teacher. He said I had a natural swing, which, I&#x2019;ve since learned, is what pros always say at your first lesson. It&#x2019;s more merciful than: &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have a brighter future chopping cane.&#x201d;The early sessions did seem to go well, and Harold was en- couraging. As time passed, however, he began chain-smoking heavily during our lessons, which suggested to me the existence of a chronic problem for which Harold had no solution. The problem was largely in my head, and fell under the clinical heading of Wildly Unrealistic Expectations.My first major mistake was prematurely asking to join my father for nine holes, a brisk Sunday outing during which I unraveled like a crackhead at a Billy Graham crusade. This was because I&#x2019;d foolishly expected to advance the golf ball down the fairway in a linear path. The experience was marred by angry tears, muffled profanities and long, brittle periods of silence. Worse, a pattern was established that would continue throughout the years that Dad and I played together.Golfers like maxims, and here&#x2019;s a good one: Beginners should never be paired with good players, especially if the good player is one&#x2019;s own father.The harder I tried, the uglier it got. To say that I didn&#x2019;t bear my pain stoically is an understatement. Dad suffered along with me and so did his golf game, which added to my sullen mood an oppressive layer of guilt.There were rare sunbursts of hope when I managed to hit a decent shot or sink a putt, but usually a pall of Nordic gloom followed us around the links. My father was a saint for tolerating my tantrums and sulking. He never once ditched me; whenever I asked to tag along on his regular weekend game, he&#x2019;d say yes despite knowing what histrionics lay ahead. As I grew taller he generously bought me a set of Ben Hogans, which were so gorgeous that at first I was reluctant to throw them.Interestingly, I have no recollection of my father and me completing a round of golf, with the exception of a father-son charity event (and the only reason I didn&#x2019;t flee on the back nine was that I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get back to the clubhouse). I can&#x2019;t recall our final score, probably for the same reason that victims of serious traffic accidents often cannot remember getting in the car. Trauma wipes clean the memory banks.In high school some of my friends took up golf, and occasionally I joined them on weekends. Surrounded by retirement developments, the Lauderdale Lakes course was a scraggly, unkempt layout that was chosen by us for its dirt-cheap, all-day green fees. Despite the trampled fairways and corrugated greens, I actually started enjoying myself&#x2014;the mood was loose and raunchy, and it was uplifting to discover that my friends stroked the ball as erratically as I did. We were the youngest players on that course by half a century, a disparity that every round precipitated one or two prickly confrontations with foursomes who were less agile and alert. That, of course, only added to the sportive atmosphere.Occasionally we also played a chaotic par-3 layout, upon which I once bladed a 9-iron dead into the cup for an ace. It was a feat that I never replicated. My name (misspelled, naturally) was etched into a hokey hole-in-one plaque that was hung among literally hundreds of others in the funky little clubhouse.My father was undoubtedly relieved that I&#x2019;d found other golfing companions, freeing him to resume his regular Sunday rounds in peace. Unfortunately, bursitis was making it increasingly difficult for him to swing a club, and by the time I left for college he was playing infrequently, and in pain.During my first semester at Emory University I got married and soon thereafter became a father, so for a time I was too preoccupied&#x2014;and too broke&#x2014;for golf.In the summer of 1972 I entered the journalism college at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where I reconnected with my high school buddies. The university maintains a top-notch par-72 that was in those days open to students for $2.50. It was there I broke 90 for the first and only time before giving up the game.I was walking eighteen in a group that included a good friend, Al Simmens. He was hitting the ball well but I was all over the map, scrambling for bogeys and doubles. In the midst of butchering a long par-4, I improbably holed out a full 7-iron for a birdie. Exclamations of amused wonder arose from Big Al and the others. Then, supernaturally, two holes later I knocked in a 9-iron from about 110 yards.This time Al keeled over as if felled by a sniper. Once before I&#x2019;d seen him collapse like that on a golf course. It had happened when he was kneecapped by a drive struck by Larry Robinson, a member of our own foursome&#x2014;the most astoundingly bad tee shot that I&#x2019;ve ever witnessed, to this day. Al had been next up, standing dead even with Larry and seemingly safe, when Larry&#x2019;s abominably mishit ball shot off the tee at a 90 degree angle and smashed into Al&#x2019;s right leg. The impact sounded like a Willie McCovey home run. Incredibly, Al was upright within minutes, and resumed playing with only a slight limp.But after my second hole-out on that morning in Gainesville, he lay lifeless in the fairway with a glassy expression that called to mind Queequeg, the Pacific Island cannibal in <i>Moby-Dick</i>, who&#x2019;d lapsed into a grave trance upon seeing his fate in a throw of the bones. Eventually Al arose and rejoined our group, but he was rocky.I completed the round with no further heroics yet I walked off the 18th green with an 88, my best score ever. That was in the summer of 1973, and by the end of the year I was done. The Hogans sat in a closet, gathering dust.Richard Nixon was hunkered like a meth-crazed badger in the White House, Hank Aaron was one dinger shy of Babe Ruth&#x2019;s all-time home run record, and The Who had just released Quadrophenia.At age twenty, I was more or less at peace.Toad GolfMy divorce from golf was uncomplicated and amic- able. When I came home from college on visits, my father and I would spend Sunday afternoons watching the PGA on television. Dad had always asserted that Sam Snead was the greatest player of all time, but he was gradually coming around to the possibility that Jack Nicklaus was something special.Then, in February 1976, my father died suddenly at the outrageously unfair age of fifty, a tragedy that extinguished any lingering whim I might have had to tackle golf again with serious intent. Apparently I played a round later that year with a friend, although my memory of it is fogged.Possibly I've blocked out other rounds, too. My brother, Rob, says that he and I golfed together one time not long after Dad passed away. "It wasn't good," he tells me.The next time I recall swinging a club wasn't in any conventional, or socially acceptable, format.It occurred one night that same year, when my best friend and fishing companion, Bob Branham, called to report a disturbing infestation. The culprit was <i>Bufo marinus, </i>a large and brazen type of toad that had invaded South Florida from Central America and proliferated rapidly, all but exterminating the more docile native species. The <i>Bufo </i>grows to two pounds and eats anything that fits in its maw, including small birds and mice. When threatened, it excretes from two glands behind its eyes a milky toxin extremely dangerous to mammals. Adventuresome human substance abusers have claimed that licking <i>Bufo </i>toads produces psychedelic visions, but the practice is often fatal for dogs and cats.Which is why Bob had called. Every evening a brigade of <i>Bufo</i>s had been appearing outside his back door and gobbling all the food he'd put out for Dixie, his young Labrador retriever. It's probably unnecessary to point out that while Labradors possess a cheery and endearing temperament, they are not Mensa candidates in the kingdom of canines. In fact, Labs will eagerly eat, lick or gnaw objects far more disgusting than a sweaty toad. For that reason, Bob expressed what I felt was a well-founded fear that his beloved pet was in peril during these nightly <i>Bufo </i>encounters.When I arrived at his house, the onslaught was in progress. A herd of medium-sized toads hungrily patrolled the perimeter of his patio, while one exceptionally rotund specimen had vaulted into Dixie's dish and engulfed so much dog chow that it was unable to climb out. It looked like a mud quiche with eyeballs.As kids, Bob and I had roamed the Everglades collecting wild critters, so neither of us wanted to harm the <i>Bufo</i>s. Yet there seemed no choice but to remove them quickly and by force, before his dopey dog slurped one like a Popsicle.Ballasted with Alpo, the toads would have been easy to capture by hand. That, however, would have presented two serious problems. One was the poison; the other was pee. Toads are prodigious pissers, and <i>Bufo</i>s in particular own hair-trigger bladders. The instant you pick one up, the hosing commences and does not cease until you drop it.Bob and I were discussing our limited and unsavory options when I noticed a golf bag in a corner near the back door. We had a brief conversation about which of his neighbors was the most obnoxious, and then I reached for a 9-iron. Bob chose a 7.Before the PETA rally begins, let me point out that an adult <i>Bufo </i>toad is one of God's sturdiest creatures. Bob swears he once saw one get run over by a compact car and then hop away. I have my doubts, but in any case we purposely picked lofted clubs to effect a kinder, gentler relocation.Aerodynamically, your average toad travels through the air with substantially more drag than a golf ball. This is because golf balls are usually round, and legless. A toad won't carry as far, or roll more than once or twice when it lands. Nonetheless, I soon found the range with Bob's 9-iron, chipping several beefy <i>Bufo</i>s onto a window awning two houses away. Even at that distance we could hear the feisty invaders clomping across the flimsy aluminum before free-falling into the backyard of their new, unsuspecting hosts.Purists probably wouldn't consider clandestine toad launching as true golf, but for accuracy's sake it must be reported that I took five or six swings with an iron that night. The next time I touched a club was in August 1977, while vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina. The trip stands out for two reasons: Elvis Presley died that week, and I got my first (and last) taste of genuine mountain moonshine. However, I was neither grief-stricken nor bombed when I accompanied a friend to a municipal driving range, which--using borrowed clubs--I chopped into wet clots of flying sod.During self-imposed retirement I continued to follow the professional tour as a fan, and in 1978 I even attended what was then called the Jackie Gleason Inverrary Classic in Lauderhill. On the afternoon that I was in the gallery, Nicklaus ran off five consecutive birdies on his way to dusting the field. His performance was so otherwordly that it validated my decision to abandon the game; the only way I belonged on a golf course was as a spectator.Then, in November 2002, another slip occurred, and it ultimately set me on the cart path to perdition.</p><h2>The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade</h2><p>Frank Miller, along with co-writer Brian Azarrello and artist John Romita Jr., revisit the gritty world of to the best-selling and genre-defining graphic novel, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, with this time telling prequel, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS: THE LAST CRUSADE, The tale of Batman&#x2019;s last adventure before his retirement and eventual return years later.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the Joker is manically returned to Arkham Asylum, Bruce Wayne is struggling to train his sidekick and heir apparent, the new Robin, Jason Todd.

The story only ends there, however, if you're fortunate enough to live in an <i>adequate</i> civilization. Eliezer Yudkowsky's <i>Inadequate Equilibria</i> is a sharp and lively guidebook for anyone questioning when and how they can know better, and do better, than the status quo. Freely mixing debates on the foundations of rational decision-making with tips for everyday life, Yudkowsky explores the central question of when we can (and can't) expect to spot systemic inefficiencies, and exploit them.</p><p>Inadequate Equilibria is a book about a generalized notion of efficient markets, and how we can use this notion to guess where society will or won't be effective at pursuing some widely desired goal.An efficient market is one where smart individuals should generally doubt that they can spot overpriced or underpriced assets. We can ask an analogous question, however, about the "efficiency" of other human endeavors.Suppose, for example, that someone thinks they can easily build a much better and more profitable social network than Facebook, or easily come up with a new treatment for a widespread medical condition. Should they question whatever clever reasoning led them to that conclusion, in the same way that most smart individuals should question any clever reasoning that causes them to think AAPL stock is underpriced? Should they question whether they can "beat the market" in these areas, or whether they can even spot major in-principle improvements to the status quo? How "efficient," or adequate, should we expect civilization to be at various tasks?There will be, as always, good ways and bad ways to reason about these questions; this book is about both.<b>--Eliezer Yudkowsky</b>Eliezer Yudkowsky is a decision theorist and computer scientist at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, California who is known for his work in technological forecasting.

Our quarter was a quiet area of South Amsterdam known as the River Quarter because the streets were named after Dutch and other European rivers whose lower courses flowed through the Netherlands to the sea, like the Rhine, the Maas, the Jeker. In fact, the Amstel flowed practically into our own backyards.<br><br>This section had been built up during the 1920s and early '30s when large, progressive corporations had built great blocks of apartments for their members with the help of government loans. We were all quite proud of this forward-looking treatment of ordinary working people: comfortable housing, indoor plumbing, tree-filled gardens in the rear of each block. Other big blocks were built entirely by private firms.<br><br>Actually, our quarter wasn't altogether quiet. Almost always, lively children filled the air with shouts and laughter; if they weren't playing games, they were whistling upward to call their friends out to play. A friendship included a one-of-a-kind tune whistled loudly to call the friend and identify who was downstairs. Children were always in each other's company, charging off in little packs to the Amstelpark swimming pool, or perhaps speaking in singsong as they walked to and from school in bunches. Dutch children, like their parents, learned faithfulness in friendship very young, and would just as quickly turn implacable if any wrong was done to a friend.<br><br>Gaaspstraat was much like all the other streets, filled with a great five-story block of apartments. There were doorways up and down the street leading to steep stairways. The buildings were constructed of dark brown brick with sloping orange roofs. There were windows both front and back, all wood-trimmed and painted white, each window with a different white lace curtain, and never without flowers or plants.<br><br>Our backyard was filled with elm trees. Across the way was a little grassy playground, and on the other side of the playground was a Roman Catholic church whose ringing bells punctuated the day and sent birds flying against the sky: sparrows; pigeons, which were kept on the roofs; gulls. Always gulls.<br><br>Our quarter was bordered on the east by the Amstel, with boats going back and forth, and on the north by the stately Zuideramstellaan Boulevard, where streetcar number 8 ran, and poplars grew on either side, in straight rows. Zuideramstellaan met Scheldestraat, one of the neighborhood shopping streets filled with shops, cafes, and open flower stalls with cans of bright, fresh flowers.<br><br>But Amsterdam was not my native city. I had been born in Vienna, Austria, in 1909. When I was five years old, the First World War began. We children had no way of knowing that the war had begun, except that one day we heard soldiers marching in the streets. I remember feeling great excitement, and I ran out alone to take a look. I was aware of uniforms, equipment, and many emotional displays between people. To get a better look, I ran between the marching men and horses. A man from the fire brigade grabbed me, hoisted me into his arms, and carried me home, as I craned my neck to see more.<br><br>In Vienna, there were old buildings, not in good condition, built around central courtyards and broken up into many apartments filled with working people. We lived in one of these dark apartments. The man from the fire brigade returned me to my anxious mother and left. My mother told me gravely, "There are soldiers in the streets. It's not safe. Don't go out there."<br><br>I didn't understand, but I did as I was told. Everyone was acting so strangely. As I was so young, I remember very little about those days, except that two uncles who lived with us had to go to war, and much was made of this.<br><br>Both uncles returned safely, and by that time one had married. Neither one came back to live with us, so by the time the war ended I lived with just Mother, Father, and Grandmother.<br><br>I was not the strongest child, and because of the serious food shortages during the war, I had become undernourished and sick. I was a small child to begin with, and seemed to be wasting away, rather than growing normally. My legs were sticks dominated by bony kneecaps. My teeth were soft. When I was ten years old, my parents had another child; another daughter. Now there was even less food for us all. My condition was worsening, and my parents were told that something had to be done or I would die.<br><br>Because of a program that had been set up by foreign working people for hungry Austrian children, a plan was devised that might rescue me from my fate. I was to be sent with other Austrian workers' children to the faraway country called the Netherlands to be fed and revitalized.<br><br>It was winter -- always bitter in Vienna -- December of 1920, and I was bundled up in whatever my parents could find and taken to the cavernous Vienna railway station. There we waited long, tiring hours, during which we were joined by many other sickly children. Doctors looked me over, probing and examining my thin, weak body. Although I was eleven, I looked much younger. My long, fine dark blond hair was held back with a large piece of cotton cloth tied into a big puffed bow. A card was hung around my neck. On it was printed a strange name, the name of people I had never met.<br><br>The train was filled with many children like me, all with cards around their necks. Suddenly, the faces of my parents were no longer in sight anywhere and the train had begun to move. All the children were scared and apprehensive about what was to become of us. Some were crying. Most of us had never even been outside our streets, certainly never outside Vienna. I felt too weak to observe much, but found the chugging motion of the train made me sleepy. I slept and woke. The trip went on and on and on.<br><br>It was pitch-black, the middle of the night, when the train stopped and we were shaken awake and led off the train. The sign beside the still-steaming train said Leiden.<br><br>Speaking to us in a totally foreign language, people took us into a large, high-ceilinged room and sat us on hard-backed wooden chairs. All the children were in long rows, side by side. My feet didn't reach the floor. I felt very, very sleepy.<br><br>Opposite the exhausted, sick children crowded a group of adults. Suddenly, these adults came at us in a swarm and began to fumble with our cards, reading off the names. We were helpless to resist the looming forms and fumbling hands.<br><br>A man, not very big but very strong-looking, read my tag. <i>"Ja,"</i> he said firmly, and took my hand in his, helping me down from the chair. He led me away. I was not afraid and went with him willingly.<br><br>We walked through a town, past buildings that had very different shapes from those of Viennese buildings I had seen. The moon was shining down, creamy, luminous. It was clear weather. The shining moonlight made it possible to see. I was intently looking for where we were going.<br><br>I saw that we were walking away from the town. There were no more houses; there were trees. The man had begun to whistle. I became angry. He must be a farmer, I thought. He must be whistling for his dog to come. I was desperately frightened of big dogs. My heart sank.<br><br>However, we kept on walking and no dog came, and suddenly more houses appeared. We came to a door. It opened and we went upstairs. A woman with an angular face and soft eyes stood there. I looked into the house, past a stairway landing, and saw heads of many children staring down at me. The woman took me by the hand into another room and gave me a glass of frothy milk. Then she guided me up the stairs.<br><br>All the children were gone. The woman took me into a small room. It contained two beds. In one bed was a gift my age. The woman took off all my layers of clothes, removed the bow from my hair, and put me between the covers in the center of the other bed. Warmth enfolded me. My eyelids dropped shut. Immediately, I was asleep.<br><br>I will never forget that journey.<br><br>The next morning the same woman came to the room, dressed me in clean clothes, and took me downstairs. There at the big table sat the strong man, the girl my age from the bedroom, and four boys of all different ages; all the faces that had stared at me the night before now looked curiously at me from around the table. I understood nothing of what they said and they understood nothing of what I said, until the oldest boy, who was studying to be a teacher, began to use the bits of German he had learned in school to translate simple things for me. He became my interpreter.<br><br>Despite the language problem, all the children were kind to me. Kindness, in my depleted condition, was very important to me. It was medicine as much as the bread, the marmalade, the good Dutch milk and butter and cheese, the toasty temperature of the warm rooms. And, ahhh, the little chocolate flakes known as "hailstones" and other chocolate bits called "little mice" they taught me to put on thickly buttered bread -- treats I'd never imagined before.<br><br>After several weeks, some of my strength began to return. All the children were in school, including the eldest, my interpreter. Everyone believed that the quickest way for a child to learn the Dutch language was to go to a Dutch school. So the man took me again by the hand to the local school and had a long talk with the school's director. The director said, "Have her come to our school."<br><br>In Vienna, I had been in the Fifth Class, but here in Leiden I was put back into the Third Class. When the director brought me into the strange class, explaining in Dutch to the children who I was, they all wanted to help me; so many hands reached out to guide me that I didn't know which one to grab first. The children all adopted me. There is a children's story in which a little child in a wooden cradle is washed away by a flood and is floating on the raging waters, in danger of sinking, when a cat leaps onto the cradle and jumps from side to side of it, keeping the cradle afloat until it touches solid ground again and the child is safe. I was the child, and all these Dutch people in my life were the cats.<br><br>By the end of January, I could understand and speak a few words of Dutch.<br><br>By spring I was the best in the class.<br><br>My Stay in Holland was to have been for three months, but I was still weak by that time and the doctors extended it another three months, and then another. Quickly, this family began to absorb me. They started to consider me one of them. The boys would say, "We have two sisters."<br><br>The man I was beginning to think of as my adoptive father was a supervisor of workers in a coal company in Leiden. Despite five children of his own, this man and his wife, although not well off by any means, took the attitude that where seven could eat, so could eight, and so they slowly revitalized their little hungry child from Vienna. At first, they called me by my proper name, Hemline, but as the ice between us melted, they found the name too formal and began calling me by an affectionate Dutch nickname, Miep.<br><br>I took to Dutch life quite naturally. <i>Gezellig,</i> or coziness, is the Dutch theme. I learned to ride a bicycle, to butter my bread sandwiches on two sides. I was taught a love of classical music by these people, and that it was my duty to be politically aware and read the newspaper each evening, later discussing what I'd read.<br><br>I failed miserably in one area of Dutch life. When the winter became cold enough for the water of the canals to freeze, the Nieuwenhuises bundled me up with the other children and took us to the frozen canal. It was a festive atmosphere: stalls selling hot chocolate and hot anise milk; whole families skating together, one behind the next, their arms hooked to a long pole to swing themselves around; the horizon always fiat and luminous, the winter sun reddish.<br><br>They strapped a pair of wooden skates with curling blades to my shoes with leather thongs, and pushed me out onto the frozen surface. Seeing my panic, they pushed a wooden chair out onto the ice and instructed me to push the chair ahead of me. My misery must have shown, because shortly I was helped to the side of the canal. Frozen and miserable, I fought to untie the knotted, wet thongs without my gloves. The knots wouldn't budge as my fingers grew more and more frozen. My rage and misery mounted, and I vowed to myself never again to go anywhere near the ice. I've kept that vow.<br><br>When I was thirteen, the whole family moved to South Amsterdam, to the quarter where all the streets are named for rivers. Even though this quarter was at the very edge of the City of Amsterdam and bordered on the Amstel River, with green pastureland and black-and-white cows grazing, we were living in the city. I loved city life. I particularly delighted in Amsterdam's electric streetcars and canals and bridges and sluices, birds, cats, speeding bicycles, bright flower stalls and herring stands, antiquities, gabled canal houses, concert halls, movie theaters, and political clubs.<br><br>In 1925, when I was sixteen, the Nieuwenhuises took me back to Vienna to see my blood relatives. I was surprised at the beauty of Vienna, and felt strange with these now-unfamiliar people. As the visit drew to a close, my anxiety mounted about my departure. But my natural mother spoke frankly to my adoptive parents. "It's better if Hermine goes back to Amsterdam with you. She has become Dutch. I think that she would not be happy if she stayed now in Vienna." My knots untied and I felt great relief.<br><br>I did not want to hurt my natural family's feelings, and I was still young and needed their consent. But I wanted desperately to return to the Netherlands. My sensibilities were Dutch, the quality of my feelings also Dutch.<br><br>During my late teens, some of my heartiness turned inward. I became staunchly independent and began to read and think about philosophy. I read Spinoza and Henri Bergson. I began to fill notebooks with my most private thoughts, jotting endlessly. I did all this in secret, for myself only, not for discussion. I had a deep longing for an understanding of life.<br><br>Then, as forcefully as it had assaulted me, the passion for notebook-keeping lifted. I felt suddenly embarrassed, self-conscious, fearful that someone would chance upon these very private thoughts. In one purge I tore all my writings in two and threw them away, never again to write in this way. At eighteen, I left school and went to work in an office. Although I continued to be a staunchly private and independent woman, my zest for life turned outward again.<br><br>In 1931, at twenty-two, I returned again to Vienna to see my parents. This time I was a grown woman and traveled alone. Having been employed for some time, I had corresponded regularly with them and had sent money whenever I could. It was a good visit, but this time no mention was made of the possibility of my returning to Austria. I was now Dutch through and through. The hungry little eleven-year-old Viennese girl with the tag tied around her neck and a bow in her hair had faded away entirely. I was now a robust young Dutch woman.<br><br>Because during my visits to Vienna none of us had thought to have any change made in my passport, on paper I was still an Austrian citizen. But when I bade farewell to my mother, father, and sister in Austria, I did so with a clarity about my identity. I knew I would continue to write and send money regularly, that I would periodically visit them and bring my children to see them when that time came, but that Holland would be my home forever.<br><br>Copyright � 1987 by Miep Gies and Alison Leslie Gold</p><h2>The Whole Goat Handbook: Recipes, Cheese, Soap, Crafts &amp; More</h2><p>Goats are the hottest animal today to raise for hobby farmers, commercial farmers, and members of both 4-H and FFA.

For Queenie Bean, a young farm wife, a highlight of each week is the gathering of the Persian Pickle Club, a group of local ladies dedicated to improving their minds, exchanging gossip, and putting their quilting skills to good use. When a new member of the club stirs up a dark secret, the women must band together to support and protect one another. In her magical, memorable novel, Sandra Dallas explores the ties that unite women through good times and bad.</p></p><p><p>SANDRA DALLAS is the author of thirteen novels, including <i>Fallen Women, True Sisters</i>, <i>The Bride's House</i>, <i>Whiter Than Snow</i>, <i>Prayers for Sale</i>, <i>Tallgrass</i> and <i>New Mercies</i>. She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week</i> magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado.</p>This entertaining second novel from the author of the well-received Buster Midnight's Cafe could be a sleeper. Set in Depression-era Kansas and made vivid with the narrator's humorous down-home voice, it's a story of loyalty and friendship in a women's quilting circle. Young farm wife Queenie Bean tells about the brief membership of a city girl named Rita, whose boredom with country living and aspirations to be an investigative reporter lead her to unearth secrets in the close-knit group, called the Persian Pickle Club after a coveted paisley print. Queenie's desire to win Rita's friendship ("We were chickens... and Rita was a hummingbird") clashes with her loyalty to the Pickles when Rita tries to solve the murder of a member's husband, in the process unearthing complicated relationships among the women who meet each week to quilt and read aloud to each other. The result is a simple but endearing story that depicts small-town eccentricities with affection and adds dazzle with some late-breaking surprises. Dallas hits all the right notes, combining an authentic look at the social fabric of Depression-era life with a homespun suspense story.

She takes us by her side down hospital corridors to visit the wards and meet her unforgettable patients.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the neonatal unit, premature babies fight for their lives, hovering at the very edge of survival, like tiny Emmanuel, wrapped up in a sandwich bag. On the cancer wards, the nurses administer chemotherapy and, long after the medicine stops working, something more important--which Watson learns to recognize when her own father is dying of cancer. In the pediatric intensive care unit, the nurses wash the hair of a little girl to remove the smell of smoke from the house fire. The emergency room is overcrowded as ever, with waves of alcohol and drug addicted patients as well as patients like Betty, a widow suffering chest pain, frail and alone. And the stories of the geriatric ward--Gladys and older patients like her--show the plight of the most vulnerable members of our society.&nbsp;<br><br> Through the smallest of actions, nurses provide vital care and kindness. All of us will experience illness in our lifetime, and we will all depend on the support and dignity that nurses offer us; yet the women and men who form the vanguard of our health care remain unsung. In this age of fear, hate, and division, Christie Watson has written a book that reminds us of all that we share, and of the urgency of compassion.</p><p><b>Christie Watson</b>&nbsp;was a registered nurse for twenty years before writing full time. Her first novel, <i>Tiny Sunbirds Far Away</i>, won the Costa First Novel Award and her second novel, <i>Where Women Are Kings</i>, was also published to international critical acclaim. Her works have been translated to eighteen languages. She lives in London.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** Copyright � 2018 Christie Watson<br><br><p><i>Nursing was left to &#x201c;those who were too old, too weak, too drunken, too dirty, too stupid or too bad to do anything else.&#x201d;</i></p><p>FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t always want to be a nurse. I went through a number of career possibilities and continually exasperated the careers advisor at my failing secondary school. &#x201c;Marine biologist&#x201d; was one career choice that I listed, having visions of wearing a swimsuit all day in a sunny climate and swimming with dolphins. When I discovered that much of the work of a marine biologist involved studying plankton off the coast of Wales, I had a rethink. During one summer in Swansea I spent time watching my great-great-aunt gutting catfish in the large kitchen sink; and once I went out on a boat with hairy, gruff and burly yellow-booted men who pissed in the sea and swore continually. I&#x2019;d also eaten winkles and cockle-bread for break- fast. Marine biology was definitely out.</p><p>&#x201c;Law,&#x201d; a teacher remarked, when my parents, also exasperated with me by then, asked what I might be suited to. &#x201c;She can argue all day long.&#x201d; But I had no aptitude for focused study. Instead I looked toward other animals and conservation. I dreamed of doing photography for the <i>National Geo- graphic</i>, leading to travel in hot and exotic locations where the sun would shine and I would wear a swimsuit all day after all, and live in flip-flops. I joined marches and anti&#x2013;animal cruelty campaigns, and gave out leaflets in the gray-brick town center of Stevenage showing pictures of dogs being tortured, rabbits having cosmetics tested on them until their eyes became red, and bloody, skeletal cats. I wore political badges that were outdoor-market cheap and came loose, stabbing me until one evening I found a tiny constellation of pin-prick bruises on my chest. I refused to go into the living room after my mum bought a stuffed chick from a flea market and placed it among her ornaments, and instead ate my vegetarian dinner on the stairs in protest, saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me or the chick. I cannot be associated with murder.&#x201d;</p><p>My mum, with endless patience, constantly forgave my teenage angst, removed the chick, made me another cheese sandwich and gave me a hug. It was she who taught me the language of kindness, though I didn&#x2019;t appreciate it back then. The next day I stole a rat from school, to save it from dissection by the biology department. I called it Furter, and hoped it would live safely with my existing pet rat, Frank, which used to sit on my shoulder, its long tail swinging around me like a statement necklace. Of course, Frank ate Furter.</p><p>Swimmer, jazz trumpeter, travel agent, singer, scientist . . . Astronomy was a possibility until, at the age of twelve, I dis- covered that my dad, who had taught me the name of every constellation, had made it all up. I didn&#x2019;t tell him, though; I still let him point upward and tell me his stories, with his enthusiasm for narrative bursting into the sky. &#x201c;There&#x2014;the shape of a hippo? You see it? That&#x2019;s called Oriel&#x2019;s Shoulder. And that is the Bluebell. You see the shape? The almost silver- blue color of those particular stars? Fishermen believe that if you look to the stars hard enough, they will whisper the secrets of the earth. Like hearing the secrets of the sea inside a shell. If you listen hard, you can hear nothing and everything, all at the same time.&#x201d;</p><p>I spent hours and hours looking at the stars to hear the secrets of the earth. At night I pulled out a cardboard box full of treasures from underneath my bed: old letters, a broken key ring, my dead grandfather&#x2019;s watch, a single drachma; chewing gum that I had retrieved from underneath a desk, and which had been in the mouth of a boy I liked; stones I had collected from various places, and a large shell. I would stand in my bed- room looking up toward the stars, holding the shell to my ear.</p><p>One night, burglars came to steal meat from our freezer, which we kept in the garden shed. Those were the days when people bought meat in bulk at flea markets, from men on giant lorries with loudspeakers and dirty white aprons. Those were the days when police would come at night to investigate frozen-chicken theft, and my star-watching was interrupted by police shouting. The universe had answered my shell-call: vegetarianism mattered. I am not sure which would have been a more unusual sight that night: a few young men carrying a frozen chicken and a giant packet of lamb chops, or a skinny teenager in a moonlit bedroom, with a large shell pressed against her ear.</p><p>What I would do&#x2014;and who I would be&#x2014;consumed me in a way that didn&#x2019;t seem to worry my friends. I didn&#x2019;t understand then that I wanted to live many lives, to experience different ways of living. I didn&#x2019;t know then that I would find exactly what I searched for (minus the swimsuit and the sun): that both nursing and writing are about stepping into other shoes all the time.</p><p>From the age of twelve I always had part-time jobs. I worked in a caf� cleaning the ovens&#x2014;a disgusting job, with mean women who used to make the teabags last three cups. I did a milk route, carrying milk during the freezing winter, until I could no longer feel my fingers. I did a paper route, until I was found dumping papers in dog-shit alley. I didn&#x2019;t make any effort at school; I did no homework. My parents tried to expand my horizons, give me ideas about what I might do and a work ethic: &#x201c;Education is a ticket to anywhere. You have a brilliant brain, but you don&#x2019;t want to use it.&#x201d; I was naturally bright but, despite the tools my parents gave me and their <i>joie de vivre</i>, my poor school-work ethic and my flightiness continued. They always encouraged me to read, and I was consumed by philosophy, looking for answers to my many questions: Sartre, Plato, Aristotle, Camus&#x2014;I was hooked. A love of books was the best gift they ever gave me. I liked to roam and not be far from reading material; I hid books around the estate: <i>Little Women </i>in the Black Alley; Dostoevsky behind Catweazel&#x2019;s bins; Dickens under Tinker&#x2019;s broken-down car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I left school at sixteen and moved in with my twenty-something boyfriend and his four twenty-something male lodgers. It was unbelievably chaotic, but I was blissfully content working a stint at a video shop, handing out VHS videos to the Chinese takeaway next door in exchange for chicken chow mein, my vegetarianism now beginning to wane, as I concentrated on putting on 18-rated films in the shop and filling the place with my friends. I went to agricultural college to become a farmer and lasted two weeks. A BTEC in travel and tourism lasted a week. To say that I had no direction was an understatement.</p><p>I was truly devastated when, after turning up late for an interview, I did not get the job of children&#x2019;s entertainer at Pizza Hut. It was a shock when my relationship broke down, despite being only sixteen and completely naive. My pride meant that I would never go home. No job, no home. So I worked for Community Service Volunteers, which was the only agency I could find at the time that accepted sixteen-year-olds instead of eighteen-year-olds and provided accommodation. I was sent to a residential center run by the Spastics Society (now called Scope), earning �20 pocket money a week by looking after adults with severe physical disabilities: helping them to toilet, eat and dress. It was the first time I felt as if I was doing some- thing worthwhile. I had begun eating meat and I had a bigger cause. I shaved my head and lived in charity-shop clothes, spending all my pocket money on cider and tobacco. I had nothing, but I was happy. And it was the first time I&#x2019;d been around nurses. I watched the qualified nurses with the kind of intensity that a child watches her parents when she&#x2019;s sick. My eyes didn&#x2019;t leave them. I had no language for what they were doing, or for their job.</p><p>&#x201c;You should do nursing,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;They give you a bursary and somewhere to live.&#x201d;</p><p>I went to the local library and discovered an entire building full of waifs and strays like me. I had been to my school library, and to the library in Stevenage, many times when I was much younger, but this library was about more than simply learning and borrowing books. It was a place of sanctuary. There was a homeless man asleep, and the librarians left him alone. A woman on a mobility scooter was being helped by a man who had a sign round his neck that said he had autism and was there to help, reaching a book on a top shelf for her. There were children running around freely, and groups of younger teenagers huddled together, laughing.</p><p>I found out about Mary Seacole, who&#x2014;like Florence Nightingale&#x2014;nursed soldiers during the Crimean War. She began experimenting in nursing by administering medicine to a doll, and then progressed to pets, before helping humans. I hadn&#x2019;t considered nursing as a profession before, but then I began remembering: my brother and I purposefully ripped the stuffing out of soft toys or pulled the glass eyes from dolls, so that I could fix them. I remembered my primary-school class- mates queuing for an anaemia check-up; I must have bragged about my specialist knowledge, before lining them up outside school and pulling down their eyelids, one by one, to see if they needed to eat liver and onions; and the endless friends with sore throats whose necks I would gently press with my fingertips, as if on a clarinet. &#x201c;Lymph node.&#x201d;</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t much written about what nursing involved, or how to go about it, so I had no idea whether or not I&#x2019;d be suitable. I discovered that nursing pre-dates the history books and has long existed in every culture. One of the earliest writ- ten texts relating to nursing is the <i>Charaka-sam�hita</i>, which was compiled in India around the first century bc and stated that nurses should be sympathetic toward everyone. And nursing has strong links with Islam. In the early seventh century, faithful Muslims became nurses&#x2014;the first professional nurse in the history of Islam, Rufaidah bint Sa&#x2019;ad, was described as an ideal nurse, due to her compassion and empathy.</p><p>Sympathy, compassion, empathy: this is what history tells us makes a good nurse. I have often revisited in my head that trip to the library in Buckinghamshire, as those qualities seem to have been lacking all too often during my career&#x2014;qualities that we&#x2019;ve now forgotten or no longer value. But, at sixteen, I was full of hopeful energy and idealism. And when I turned seventeen I decided to go for it. No more career choice changes and flitting around; I would become a nurse. Plus, I knew there would be parties.</p><p>A few months later, I somehow slipped onto a nursing course, despite being younger by a couple of weeks than the official entry age of seventeen-and-a-half. I moved into nursing halls in Bedford. The halls were at the back of the hospital, a large block of flats filled with the sound of banging doors and occasional screaming laughter. Most of my corridor was made up of first-year nurses, with a few radiographers and physiotherapy students, plus the occasional doctor on rotation. The student nurses were almost all young and wild, and away from home for the first time. There were a significant number of Irish women (&#x201c;we had two choices,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d tell me, &#x201c;nurse or nun&#x201d;); and a small number of men (universally gay at the time). There was a laundry room downstairs, next to a stuffy tele- vision room with plastic-coated armchairs which the back of my legs stuck to, in the heat from the radiators on full blast twenty-four hours a day. I met a trainee psychiatrist in that television room, after inadvertently blurting out that I was stuck to the chair, and he became my boyfriend for a few years. My bedroom was next to the toilets and smelled of damp, and one of my friends once grew cress on the carpet. The kitchen was dirty and the fridge was full of out-of-date food, with a note on one cupboard stating: DO NOT STEAL OTHER PEOPLE&#x2019;S FOOD. WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.</p><p>There was one telephone in an echoing hallway, which rang at all hours of the day and night. There were arguments, and the sound of heels running and of music being played loudly. We all smoked&#x2014;cigarettes usually, but the smell of weed was like a constant low-level background noise that you didn&#x2019;t even notice after a while. We went in and out of each other&#x2019;s rooms in a communal fashion, and our doors were never locked. In my room Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s anatomical drawings of the chambers of the heart were on a poster above my bed; there was a shelf full of nursing textbooks and tatty novels, and a pile of philosophy books next to my bed. Plus a kettle, a radiator that wouldn&#x2019;t turn down and a window that didn&#x2019;t open. There was a sink to wash in (bodies and cups), to flick ash in, to vomit in and, for a few weeks when the toilets were continuously blocked, to pee in. To my contemporaries, it wasn&#x2019;t much; but after sharing a room in the residential center for so long, and previously a house with a boyfriend and his male lodgers, it was heaven to me.</p><p>The first night, though, is always the worst. I had no idea what I would be doing as a nurse, and had begun to regret not asking more questions of the nurses who had encouraged me to apply. I was terrified of failure; of the look on my parents&#x2019; faces when I announced yet another change of heart. They had been shocked enough about my decision to become a nurse: my dad actually laughed out loud. Despite my work as a carer, they still saw me as the rebellious teenager who couldn&#x2019;t care less about anyone. It was a far stretch to imagine me being devoted to kindness.</p><p>I lay awake that night and listened to the sound of my immediate neighbor arguing with her boyfriend, a moody, lanky security guard who, against all the rules, appeared to be living with her. Even after they were quiet I couldn&#x2019;t sleep. My head was dancing with doubt. I knew I&#x2019;d be classroom-based for a while at least, so I wouldn&#x2019;t kill anyone by accident, or have to wash an old man&#x2019;s penis or experience similar horrors. But I was full of anxiety. And when I went that night to the toilet, which was shared by those on the entire floor, I found a used sanitary pad stuck on the bathroom door. I retched. Aside from how vile it was, I remembered then that the sight of blood had always made me feel faint.</p><p>My queasy nature was confirmed the following morning when we had our occupational health screening. Blood samples were taken from all of us. &#x201c;To hold on file,&#x201d; the phlebotomist announced. &#x201c;In case you get a needle-stick injury and contract HIV. We can then find out if you were HIV-positive already.&#x201d; It was 1994, and misinformation and fear about HIV were everywhere. The phlebotomist tied a tourniquet around my arm. &#x201c;Are you a student nurse or a medical student?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I watched the needle, the blood filling the tube, and the room began to blur. Her voice sounded far away.</p><p>&#x201c;Christie. Christie!&#x201d; When I came round, I was lying on the floor with my legs up on the chair, and the phlebotomist above me. She laughed. &#x201c;You okay now?&#x201d;</p><p>I slowly got to my elbows, regaining focus. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You fainted, dear. Happens. Though you might want to rethink your career.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>How to Work a Room, 25th Anniversary Edition: The Ultimate Guide to Making Lasting Connections--In Person and Online</h2><p><p><strong>Fully revised and updated, the ground-breaking, classic&nbsp;book on improving communication and socializing skills in any situation to succeed in business and life</strong></p><p>Have you ever walked into a roomful of strangers and felt uncomfortable?

A PhD in Physics first took her to Madrid, Spain, where she stayed for 7 years. After casting off her hat as a nuclear physicist, Jennifer grabbed a new hat as a writer. She completed a journalism internship in Tbilisi, Georgia, before moving back to Budapest to reconnect with her Hungarian roots. She now mostly writes about travel, food, culture, and language in Central and Eastern Europe. She has written for <i>National Geographic Travel, Cond� Nast Traveler, Oxford Dictionaries, BBC Travel, The Guardian,</i> and <i>The Independent</i>, among others. Although Hungary is in her blood, Vienna is her City of Dreams: its wide boulevards and old-world caf�s continue to inspire her, as she walks in the footsteps of Klimt, Freud, and Mozart. She feels at home in Budapest's ruin bars and underground art hubs, Vienna's caf�s and museums, and prefers to spend the summers under the colonnades in the historic spa towns of Central Europe rather than on the beach. <br><br>Like so many Prague transplants, <b>Auburn Scallon </b>came to the Czech Republic planning to stay for just one year. This worked out about as well as the notorious Czech suggestion to go out for just one beer.

They teach that each of us, each Self, is eternal, deathless, one with the power that created the universe. <br><br>Easwaran&#x2019;s translation of the principal Upanishads and five others includes an overview of the cultural and historical setting, with chapter introductions, notes, and a Sanskrit glossary.

But only John tells us the servant&#x2019;s name, and that it was Peter who wielded the sword. And only Luke tells us that Jesus healed the wound. This book allows you to see all of this at a glance. THE FOUR GOSPELS are presented here in parallel columns, in roughly chronological order, with corresponding passages side by side. Among the differences that set this work apart from others are its use of the World English Bible, its copyright-free status, and its readable arrangement of the text.

Based on the best-selling hardcover book, Topgrading, by Bradford D. Smart, Ph.D., this quick-read version highlights the essential elements for building a team of A players. You ll learn how to improve your hiring and promotion success rate dramatically using Topgrading tools and techniques to recruit, screen, interview, and check references of job candidates.</p><p>The key to building a superior company, an increasing number of observers now agree, is the ongoing ability to recruit and retain superior personnel. In <i>Topgrading</i>, industrial psychologist and global consultant Bradford Smart expands upon this idea by examining in great detail exactly how today's premier organizations have assembled such top-level employees, and then showing precisely how others can do it, too. "Simply put, topgrading is the practice of packing the team with A players and clearing out the C players," Smart writes. "'A players' is defined as the top 10 percent of talent available at all salary levels--best of class. With this radical definition, you are not a topgrader until your team consists of all A players. Period." Essentially a best-practices manual for developing this outstanding personnel pool, the book is based on more than 4,000 interviews and case studies conducted by Smart at major corporations like General Electric as well as fast-growing high-tech companies and small family-owned firms. He further bolsters its effectiveness by including his extensive "Chronological In-Depth Structured Interview Guide," along with other assessment tools and hands-on strategies for assembling an ideal work team. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"Topgrading is a proven strategy for hiring 'A' Players, building 'dream teams.' Companies and individuals who topgrade gain a talent advantage -- they consistently outperform the competition and reap the rewards of excellence." Robert H. Bohannon, Chairman, President and CEO Viad Corp. <p>"Topgrading is making us a stronger company everyday. Its tenets align perfectly with Gateway's unending commitment to improving our ability to serve our customers' needs." Ted Waitt, Chairman of the Board, Gateway </p> <p>"I've had firsthand experience with Brad, and his approach to finding talent and fitting the talent to the job's requirements works. Brad's book demystifies the concept of Topgrading, and as he draws from thousands of real experiences, he provides a road map for building successful management teams. I wish he'd put this on paper a long time ago."

Elliot and three other kids from his class had been packed into a van by their harassed-looking French teacher and driven outside the city. Elliot objected because after an hour in a moving vehicle he would be violently sick. The other kids objected because after an hour in a moving vehicle they would be violently sick of Elliot.<br>Elliot ignored the other kids and hung his head out of the window. In a disdainful way.<br>Then they arrived at their destination, which could only be described as a classic example of a &#x201c;random field in Devon, England.&#x201d; Much like any other random field in England.<br>&#x201c;Why are we in a random field?&#x201d; Elliot demanded.<br>&#x201c;I will thump you,&#x201d; promised Desmond Dobbs. &#x201c;Zip it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will not be silenced,&#x201d; said Elliot.<br>He would not be silenced, but he was feeling unwell and being thumped usually made him feel worse, so he stood a little way off from the others and observed their surroundings.<br>The random field boasted a stone wall so high Elliot could not see over the top, and a woman wearing extremely odd clothing who appeared to be waiting for them. She and their French teacher had a quiet conference, and as Elliot watched them he saw money change hands.<br>&#x201c;Excuse me, did anyone else see that?&#x201d; Elliot asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wish to alarm anyone, but get alarmed, because I think our French teacher just sold us!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They haven&#x2019;t sold us,&#x201d; said Ashley Sinclair. &#x201c;Nobody would want to buy you.&#x201d;<br>That did silence Elliot. It seemed so indisputably true.<br>The woman in odd clothing &#x201c;tested&#x201d; him by asking him if he could see a wall standing in the middle of a field. When he told her, &#x201c;Obviously, because it&#x2019;s a wall. Walls tend to be obvious,&#x201d; she had pointed out the other kids blithely walking through the wall as if it was not there, and told him that he was one of the chosen few with the sight.<br>&#x201c;Are you telling me that I have magical powers?&#x201d; Elliot had asked, excited for a moment, and then added: &#x201c;Because I can&#x2019;t walk through walls? That doesn&#x2019;t seem right.&#x201d;<br>The woman had told him she was prepared for questions, but she did not seem prepared for that one. She blinked and told him to come away with her to a magical land.<br>&#x201c;By a magical land,&#x201d; she told him, &#x201c;I mean a place that not everybody can see, a place with&#x2015;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With mermaids?&#x201d; Elliot asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to explain to me the concept of a magical land filled with fantastic creatures that only certain special children can enter. I am acquainted with the last several centuries of popular culture. There are books. And cartoons, for the illiterate.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; said the woman, &#x201c;are you prepared to come away with me, or not?&#x201d;<br><br>Normally, Elliot refused weird propositions from potentially demented strangers. But there was the wall, and the undeniable fact that other people could not see or touch it, and this really was like something out of a book. Elliot did not think he would be able to live with the curiosity if he did not go.<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Elliot had said finally, brandishing his phone in the woman&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;But I have the number of the police, and I will have my finger on the call button at all times, in case you are a child predator.&#x201d;<br>She rolled her eyes, but she let him keep the phone with no objections.<br>Nobody else had any objections when it was explained that the strange woman would be driving Elliot back to school later. Nobody pointed out there was no sign of the strange woman&#x2019;s car. Desmond Dobbs said &#x201c;Hurray!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you have family who will miss you?&#x201d; asked the woman while everyone else piled in the van.<br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; said Elliot. &#x201c;That is a serial-killer question, and I refuse to answer it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Any family you have will be told you were offered a last-minute scholarship to a prestigious military school,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;If you choose to stay. Will anyone be worried about you?&#x201d;<br>The van set off down the road. It seemed to get smaller very fast, heading toward the distant gray horizon of the city. Everything Elliot knew seemed terribly small, and terribly gray, and terribly far away.Elliot hesitated. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>Once the van had disappeared around a bend in the road, the strange woman led Elliot up a narrow stone stairway built into the wall. They climbed and climbed, and when they had gone so high that they were surrounded by clouds, they walked through a shining hole in the wall and onto soft grass.<br>Actually, the magical land seemed to be mostly grass.<br>There were fields, more fields, several more fields, a couple of rough, round stone towers which men with weapons were exiting and entering. Elliot had cheered up when he saw a man walk by, books under his arm, who had long hair and pointed ears&#x2015;there were elves&#x2015;and dwarves&#x2015;like from fairy tales, men and women alike with beards and carrying elaborately carved hammers.<br><br>He looked around for other marvels.<br>Mostly there were other kids. Some of them were quite big, and some of them looked no more than Elliot&#x2019;s age&#x2015;he was thirteen, though everybody thought he was younger because they made cruel assumptions based on height. All the kids had lined up at different tables to be signed in, and now the kids Elliot&#x2019;s age were all standing together in a cluster waiting to be told what to do.<br>Elliot turned to the woman who had led him here. Her clothing did not look so strange here where a lot of people were wearing breeches and buckles all over. He had only known her for five minutes, which made her five minutes more familiar than anyone else. Under cornrows that ended in a black coronet of twisted hair, her face was impatient but not unkind.<br>&#x201c;Is this the part where I get told that only I can save the magical land?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This is the part where you get trained,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;Or not. You choose.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Trained for what?&#x201d; Elliot demanded, but the woman had already strode off to be cryptic elsewhere and left him with the group of kids his age.<br>He was slightly alarmed. The wall on the other side had been low, but carved with graffiti so he suspected there were vandals about, his phone was sizzling, and now this.<br>It was so unfair. Elliot had not expected a magical land to be all fields&#x2015;some of the fields had cows in them, and he was pretty sure they weren&#x2019;t magic cows&#x2015;and other kids.<br>Elliot especially did not like the &#x201c;other kids&#x201d; aspect of magic land. Elliot had &#x201c;does not interact well with peers&#x201d; on all his report cards.<br>If the teachers had been more precise, what they would have said was &#x201c;does not shut up well around stupid people,&#x201d; but that was teachers for you. And there were always kids who were stunned when crossed, as if they had expected that life would go their way forever.<br>Elliot had already spotted the two kids who looked as if they thought life was a song. Practically all of the relatively few girls were staring at them.<br>One of the boringly human pair of boys, the obvious leader, was tall and broad-shouldered, with golden hair, as if Nature had said, &#x201c;No worries, buddy, I gotcha, no nasty tiring thinking will ever be necessary, also have a crown.&#x201d; The other had a bright vacant smile that someone, finding it empty, had filled with light.<br>The blond guy was wandering around from kid to kid, talking kindly to them and taking hold of them by one shoulder with the patronizing air of a kid who thought he was as good and wise as a teacher. He knelt and spoke to one much smaller girl in a My Little Pony T-shirt, then rose to his feet and turned away, leaving her staring after him with shining eyes as he obviously forgot all about her: as if he were a king dispensing largesse to the peasants. The other boy was following the blond guy around, nodding at everything he said. Both of them looked entirely self-assured about the whole situation. Elliot knew their type. The blond boy looked like he would throw the first punch and the smiling boy like he would throw the second and the third, in eager imitation.<br>Elliot mentally christened them Blondie and Surfer Dude.<br>He peered around to the woods, where perhaps there were more elves, and to the skies, where he was almost sure he&#x2019;d seen something that was winged but too big to be a bird.<br><br>A cough distracted Elliot from his perusal of the skies. He looked down into blue eyes and saw that it was apparently Elliot&#x2019;s turn on the condescension rounds.<br>&#x201c;You should stop sitting on that fence,&#x201d; Blondie instructed.<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; Elliot muttered darkly. &#x201c;Even this is to be taken from me.&#x201d;<br><br>Nobody Elliot was aware of had made Blondie the boss of the fence, but being tipped over backward into the mud was not Elliot&#x2019;s idea of a good time. He slipped off the fence and looked resentfully up at Blondie and, of course, his sunny shadow. He found tall people tiresome.<br>Elliot scowled. Blondie frowned. Surfer Dude kept smiling.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, little guy. I know this must all be very confusing for people from the other side of the Border,&#x201d; said Blondie.<br>Elliot stared for a long moment. The moment grew uncomfortable. Elliot was glad.<br>&#x201c;This is all terribly confusing,&#x201d; Elliot agreed. Blondie smiled, relieved, and Elliot held up a hand to stop him saying anything. &#x201c;I was so hoping,&#x201d; Elliot continued soulfully, &#x201c;that somebody would come explain all this to me. Preferably someone who would do it in small words. And you two look like the small-words type.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure, what do you need explained?&#x201d; asked Surfer Dude.<br>Elliot rolled his eyes and saw that Blondie&#x2019;s sweet blue eyes had narrowed. He tilted his head and grinned.<br>&#x201c;First off, this,&#x201d; said Elliot, and produced his phone from his pocket. It looked a little bit melty and was sending off sparks. Surfer Dude took a step back.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better give me that,&#x201d; said Blondie. &#x201c;You could hurt yourself.&#x201d;<br>He stepped forward. Elliot took a step to the side, and the group as a whole moved away from Elliot. Everyone else had discarded their technology when it malfunctioned, because they were quitters.<br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; said Elliot. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s about to go on fire.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my thing that&#x2019;s about to go on fire, and not yours,&#x201d; Elliot said firmly. &#x201c;Now, why have all our methods of communication just literally gone up in smoke? Are we kidnapped? Are we going to be ritual sacrifices? Is there some sort of magical spell that destroys our ability to call for help?&#x201d;<br>A distressed murmuring spread across the group. Blondie looked around in dismay.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine. Your little gadgets from across the Border just don&#x2019;t work here, that&#x2019;s all. They never have. You don&#x2019;t need them here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Elliot murmured. &#x201c;The Industrial Revolution was a silly business anyway.&#x201d;<br>Everybody looked confused now, not just Surfer Dude.<br>Elliot raised his voice. &#x201c;Are you telling me none of us are going to be able to play video games?&#x201d;<br>Blondie looked like he had his doubts about answering, but he did anyway. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what a video game is . . . but I&#x2019;m pretty sure you can&#x2019;t play them here.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the other boys, who, judging by his clothes, was from what Blondie called &#x201c;the other side of the Border&#x201d; and Elliot called &#x201c;the real world where stuff made sense and phones did not explode,&#x201d; burst into tears. Blondie&#x2019;s head whipped around.<br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; Elliot exclaimed sadly. &#x201c;Look what you did.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t&#x2015;!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He seems awfully upset,&#x201d; Elliot continued. &#x201c;You must feel really bad.&#x201d;<br><br>Blondie did not look as if he felt bad at all. He looked, in fact, as if he was going to punch Elliot in the face.<br>He took a deep breath and did not, which was a pleasant surprise and made Elliot feel quite cheerful.<br>&#x201c;Go on then,&#x201d; Elliot said brightly, and made an encouraging yet dismissive gesture. &#x201c;See to the children!&#x201d;<br>Blondie turned and moved toward the crying boy, but he glanced back over his shoulder at Elliot, eyes still narrowed.<br>&#x201c;Not everyone who can see the Border belongs on the right side,&#x201d; he observed. &#x201c;Being trained to protect the Border is a sacred duty. And my father says that some people are too weak and too concerned with their own comfort to fight the good fight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fascinating. Run along.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can choose to go or stay,&#x201d; said Blondie. &#x201c;So I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be seeing you again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, oh my God, I already understood the implication that I wasn&#x2019;t man enough to tough it out beyond the Border. Your attempt at an insult was extremely clear,&#x201d; Elliot informed him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just making the whole thing laboured and awkward now.&#x201d;<br>He waved Blondie away again, and on Blondie&#x2019;s retreat Elliot squinted suspiciously up at Surfer Dude.<br>&#x201c;When he said all that stuff about duty and protection . . .,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is this a military operation?&#x201d;<br>Surfer Dude looked pleased to be asked. &#x201c;Yes. They train you up, those who can pass through the Border on either side, to be guards and keep the peace between the peoples in this land and those who may come through from the other. You learn how to handle all sorts of weapons, how to form a unit, all this cool stuff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh my God,&#x201d; Elliot said in a hollow voice. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re child soldiers?&#x201d; He considered this and then said: &#x201c;I need to sit down. I&#x2019;m going back to the fence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to&#x2015;&#x201d; Surfer Dude said, echoing his master, but Elliot was already walking away.<br>He did take Surfer Dude&#x2019;s point, and he did not want to be pushed off the fence, so he meandered along it a little, moving farther away from the group, and as he did so he came in sight of someone else who was standing slightly removed from the crowd.<br>She turned as Elliot approached.<br>She was tall, slim, and strong-looking as a young birch tree, and as she turned her long dark hair spun out in the steadily blowing wind. It formed a trail of darkness, touched by autumn leaves twined around her tresses: her pale face stood out in sharp relief, and so did the pearl-pale curling points of her ears.This was an elf maiden.<br>This was, bar none, the coolest person Elliot had ever seen.<br>Elliot only had to look at her solemn face for one long moment, robbed of breath by both the wind and her beauty, and he knew. This was love: not the passing fancy he&#x2019;d felt for Miss Tolliver his music teacher (in which he&#x2019;d become confused by having a good relationship with an authority figure), or Simon Bae (confused by admiration for his skill in their shared art project) or Clare Winters (the guidance counselor had approved and hadn&#x2019;t said Elliot was confused, but Clare had turned out to only understand a quarter of Elliot&#x2019;s jokes, so she&#x2019;d been confused all the time).<br>Elliot wasn&#x2019;t confused now, looking into those clear eyes, at once dark and bright like pools in a deep forest.<br>He tried to collect himself. Now was no time to stare like a hypnotized sheep.<br>Now was the time to woo.<br>He had not seen any other elven girls in the whole camp. So clearly she was defying conservative elven customs by coming here, brave and alone and the victim of cruel oppression. Elliot&#x2019;s heart went out to her. She was probably feeling scared and shy.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; said the beautiful elven maid. &#x201c;I was just thinking, and I mean no offence, but&#x2015;how can any fighting force crowded with the softer sex hope to prevail in battle?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; said Elliot brilliantly. &#x201c;The softer what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I refer to men,&#x201d; said the elf girl. &#x201c;Naturally I was aware the Border guard admitted men, and I support men in their endeavor to prove they are equal to women, but their natures are not warlike, are they?&#x201d;<br>Elliot offered, after a long pause: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t enjoy fighting.&#x201d;<br>She favored him with a slow smile, like dawn light spreading on water. &#x201c;Very...</p></p><h2>The Negro Question: Who Am I</h2><p>Finally a book filled with archaeological evidence, historical documents and images that prove that the so called Negro in America is the black Jew of the Bible.

Television is pervasive and common, in the sense of communal, familiar, and available to all. Television establishes our ethical, moral, social, and, God knows, material boundaries more than any other factor in modern life. More than the movies, more than politics--no wonder you want to write for it. It's powerful!<br>Because it is common, television is often dismissed as insignificant, unworthy of respect or care. Because it is pervasive it is voracious--television needs material, and it reproduces like an amoeba, constantly dividing and replicating itself to fill the continuing void.<br><br>Television needs more, and it needs it now. That's where you come in. Your job as a writer is to supply it with content. This leads to fast, which leads to sloppy, which leads to formulaic, writing.<br>"It's not brain surgery," you'll often hear people in the industry say about working in TV. As a way to deflate self-importance, it's a perfectly good sentiment, but resist the impulse to use it as an excuse to lower standards; because in a way, when you create for TV you are doing a kind of brain surgery. You are shaping people's perceptions, and affecting their reality.<br><br>A career as a writer in Hollywood begins with excellent writing (excellent by commercial standards--we'll get into that in a minute). After that it's about persistence, tenacity, and some luck, though less than you might think. These are not secrets. Everybody knows the rules. The secret is committing to them. That's what makes a career happen.<br>In order to write for TV, you must get a job. In order to get a job, you must have material to show that you can write. Usually that will be a spec script.<br><br><i> What Is a Spec Script?</i><br> <br>A television spec script is an unsolicited, original episode written for an established TV show. No money, no contract, no guarantees. In all likelihood, a spec script will never be sold or produced. What it will be is READ. That's what you write it for: to be read by as many people connected to show business as you can get it to. Everyone counts. You never know who knows someone who knows someone.<br><br>There are two different kinds of spec scripts, one for TV and one for film. You write a spec screenplay when you are not established enough to get a deal to write a screenplay based on a pitch. You write a spec screenplay and hold on to the dream that a studio will pay you for the rights to make it into a movie. Or, more likely, pay you for the rights to change it completely and never make it into a movie, but at least you get a check. You can sell a spec screenplay.<br><br>A television spec script is different. You don't write a TV spec with the expectation of selling it to the show. It could happen, it has happened--it's Hollywood, everything happens once or twice--and if it happens to you, great! Call your lawyer and make sure you're protected on the back end. (Not as sexy as it sounds, but even more exciting; see Showbiz Meanings for Regular Words: A Selective Glossary.) But what's much more likely, and therefore what we'll be talking about in this book, is that you'll write a spec TV episode to prove that you can do the work. It's a writing sample, a portfolio piece. In film, people are looking for a script, but in TV they are looking for a writer.<br><i><br>Why Write for TV?<br></i><br>I teach scriptwriting classes and when I ask students why they want to write a spec script, I usually get an answer like, "It's fun." Well, that's great, but that won't get you to the end of your script because a lot about writing isn't so much fun. A lot of it is frustrating, confusing, and downright hard.<br><br>So they think about it and I hear, "To tell a story" or "To make people laugh." I've even heard, "Because I really, really, really want to." All of those are good reasons to write something, but not necessarily a TV spec script.<br><br>The only reason to write a television episodic spec script is: money. When I teach, I usually draw a big $ on the whiteboard and everybody laughs. I suppose because that's what they were really thinking but were afraid to say. Or maybe they were even afraid to think it. Maybe they feel it's not a worthy reason to write. But the truth is that television is a commercial medium and you write it for money.<br><br>There's a story about George Bernard Shaw, who in the '30s came to Hollywood for a meeting with Samuel Goldwyn, the head of MGM. Goldwyn wanted the rights to Shaw's plays, but, naturally, wanted to pay as little as possible for them. Goldwyn went on and on about what a genius Shaw was, how much he admired his plays, what a great artist he was, and how he, Goldwyn, was also a great artist and that he, in fact, would rather make a great artistic picture than eat a good meal. Shaw finally got up, thanked Goldwyn for the meeting, but respectfully declined to sell him the rights. Goldwyn was stunned: "Why not?" Shaw replied, "The trouble, sir, is that you are interested only in art, while I am interested only in money."<br><br><i>Form Versus Formula</i><br><br>What writing for money means is that when you sit down to write you have to follow the rules. By rules, I don't mean formula--formula is what makes a writer a hack, and leads to predictable, dull scripts that nobody wants to read past page 8. However, there is form--quite a different thing. Television scripts have a specific form, and you must follow it.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you think you know how to do it better or funnier than what's on the air. That's not your job when you're writing a spec script. Your job is to do it exactly the way it's done and still be original. If you follow the rules without originality, your work will be okay but it will not distinguish itself as special.<br><br>Yes, you're writing for money, but you are not writing only for money. You must also put some art into your commercial product. It's very unlikely that you'll ever get to write for money if you don't put something of yourself into your script. The richest, most successful television writers I know have all written commercially savvy products from a personal point of view. Creative with the form? No. Creative with the content? Yes.<br><br>On any given day on any given reader's desk (or more likely, on the floor) there are going to be three piles of scripts. The piles will look like this: <br><br>Pile A, the smallest one, will be, as you probably guessed, the good scripts. The ones with a story we care about, dialogue that jumps up off the page, something very special that's worth noting. These are the scripts that will get passed along with "Recommend" written on the coverage form.<br><br>Pile C will be the hopelessly bad scripts--handwritten, incorrectly formatted, offensive, plagiarized, and so forth.<br><br>And Pile B, the one that rises endlessly to the ceiling? That is what I call the Big Pile of Okay. Scripts that look like scripts, read like scripts, and might even have some pretty good laughs. There's nothing really wrong with them, but there's nothing really right with them either. This, in my experience of reading scripts (I've read thousands, honestly), and in the experience of everyone else I know who reads scripts for a living, is the category that the vast majority of scripts fall into. I don't think I need to tell you where these scripts are going; suffice to say they are not going on to anyone else's desk.<br><br>Once, in an agent's waiting room, I picked up a scratch pad to make a note. As I tore off a page, I saw that the back had printing in the distinctive Courier font on it. These were lines of dialogue! This agent had scripts cut up and made into memo pads! You know those scripts came from Pile B.<br><br>But the good news is that many of these okay scripts could be turned into A scripts with significant commitment to the writing process. Or maybe that's the bad news; I guess it is, if you thought writing for TV was going to be easy.<br><br>The exercises in this book are tools to guide you in following the form and infusing it with your own original creative force. That will get you from the Big Pile of Okay to Recommend.<br>And if you can do that, you can probably get paid to write TV.<br><br><i>What Show Should You Spec?</i><br><br>Write a show you love to watch. That, in my opinion, is the single most important factor in choosing a show to write. Don't write a spec of a show you don't like, even if someone in the industry has told you it's the hot show to write.* When you get to pick, and your spec may be the only time you have that opportunity, by all means be picky. Only write a show that you relate to, a show you like to watch, with characters you care about. That is first and foremost--but it's not the only criterion.<br>Here are three other factors to keep in mind when choosing a show to write for.<br><br><b> 1. The show must be on the air now</b><br><br>This is a rule. Don't write a Friends spec, even if you saw every episode and you have the greatest idea for a Rachel story ever. Anything that is off the air is an old show, even if it went off yesterday and the reruns are playing every day.<br><br>There's a story that's been circulating around Holly-wood for years--you may have heard it--about somebody who wrote a great episode of the old Dick Van Dyke Show and people thought it was so gutsy and original that the writer got a lot of interest.<br><br>First of all, I don't believe that really happened--I believe someone did it, I just don't believe it got them work--and secondly, if it is true, then it's been done and no longer has any value as a gutsy original move.<br><br>So please, write only a show that's on the air.<br><br>In fact, any show that's been on the air more than five years is probably too old to write a spec for, even if it's not going off the air for a couple more seasons. If you're sending out an episode of an old show, the feeling is that you're not fresh, not current, not keeping up with the trends, and in TV, that is death.<br><br><b>2. It should be a hit show<br> </b><br>Here's why:<br><br>*A hit show is not likely to be canceled the day before you finish your spec script.<br><br>*People who will be reading your spec will be familiar with the show and the characters.<br><br>*A hit is a hit because it works. A show that works will be easier to write and will make a much better sample. One of the reasons you write a spec is to benefit and learn from a more experienced writer who created a successful show.<br><br>*Hits are copied. There will be new shows like it on the air, and those are shows that will be looking for staff. If you've written a spec of the show they've cloned, it will be an excellent sample to demonstrate how appropriate you would be for their show.<br><br>What defines a hit? It used to be that only shows in the top 10 were hits, but that's changed. In these days of more viewer choices and lower network ratings, it isn't always obvious what constitutes a hit, but numbers are still the first guide. Check the weekly rankings.* To be considered a hit, a commercial network show should be in the top 25 to 30 on the list.<br><br>You aren't limited to prime-time network programming to find on-air hit shows to write. Another reliable gauge for spec script status is awards. If a show has been nominated for Emmys, Golden Globes, or any of the various Guild* awards, it's a mark that the industry is aware of the show and respects it.<br><br>Shows like Monk (USA Network), Veronica Mars (CW), Weeds (Showtime), The Shield (fX), The Closer (TNT), and The Office (NBC) may not pull big ratings, but they have won multiple nominations for their stars and writers, which raises their profile and makes them viable choices for your spec.<br> <br><b>3. You have a connection<br> </b><br>You went to acting school with someone in the cast, your roommate's buddy is an assistant editor on the show, or your cousin knows a production assistant's life partner. If you have a genuine connection, no matter how minor, it could be a big help. For one thing, it will be easier to get scripts of the show to study, and you'll find out why that's crucial in the next chapter. If it's a multi-camera show, they shoot in front of a live audience, and your connection can get you seats for a taping and maybe even an introduction after the shoot. If it's a single-camera show, you may be able to get an invite to the set to observe.<br><br>The most important advantage is the possibility of getting your spec read by a writer on the show and a chance for some professional feedback--and, who knows, maybe even a recommendation to that writer's agent or the showrunner. But don't expect that; just ask for feedback.<br><br>Many people will advise you not to write a spec of a show you want to write for, because you won't write it as well as the writers do and they'll pick it apart. There's some truth to this; however, I think that if you know someone in any capacity at a show, the chance to get expert feedback is too good an opportunity to pass up. You might not get hired there, but you're likely to have a much-improved spec script to show to everybody else.<br> <br><b>4. Again, write a show you like</b><br> <br>This is so important it bears repeating. Even if a show meets all of the above criteria perfectly, if you don't like the show and you don't enjoy watching it, you won't write a great spec script. So find a show you like and that also meets most, if not all, of the above guidelines, and that's the show you should spec.<br><br>What if the show you love doesn't fit any of the other requirements? My grandma always told me, "It's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor one." It applies here. Wouldn't it be just as easy to love a show that meets the other requirements too? Or maybe not. My best friend fell in love with a guy who had no money when she married him and now he's a multimillionaire, they have three houses, and she's got pearls the size of golf balls. So sometimes if you ignore the good advice and just follow your heart, it works out okay. But then, that's real life--which is a lot less predictable than television.</p><h2>Haikyu!!, Vol. 14 (14)</h2><p>Shoyo Hinata is out to prove that in volleyball you don't need to be tall to fly!<br><br>Ever since he saw the legendary player known as "the Little Giant" compete at the national volleyball finals, Shoyo Hinata has been aiming to be the best volleyball player ever!

Since the family dog has pulled down the Christmas tree (or "Hanukkah bush," as his father insists they call it), presents will be arranged around the menorah, for the first time putting more emphasis on Hanukkah than Christmas. On Christmas Eve, which coincides with the first day of Hanukkah, Sam witnesses the clashing traditions of his feuding Jewish and Christian grandmothers, and he decides to ask God something that has been plaguing him: "What I want to know is, why can't people practicing different religions get along?" This question assumes greater proportions when Sam's class begins studying the Holocaust ("How could You let this happen?" he asks God), and when the boy learns they had a relative who was a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. In a rather strained subplot, Sam becomes smitten with Heather, a classmate he thinks is "cute," but whose mean-spiritedness (he finally realizes) is rooted in racism. Although the narrative becomes encumbered by some rather pointed exposition and repetitious discussion, Cooper introduces a likable young protagonist and raises some searching questions about tolerance, injustice, commitment to religion and communicating with God.

Is he on military watch? Conducting a vigil? As the hours (and chapters) tick from "five past ten" to "one minute to six" the following morning, Tommo recalls growing up in rural England at the turn of the twentieth century with his older brother, Charlie -- protector, best friend, and chief rival for the affection of their beguiling friend Molly. Exquisitely written vignettes explore bonds of brotherhood that cannot be broken by the physical and psychological horrors of the First World War. We eventually learn the reason for Tommo's sleepless night in a shattering, unexpected conclusion that is all the more effective for the stoicism with which the two brothers accept their separate but tragically entwined fates.

Now at the front in France with his older brother Charlie he stands a lonely nighttime vigil for reasons that are not explained until the book's end, watching the minutes tick by and reflecting on his past. Using first-person narration, Morpurgo draws readers into this young man's life, relating memories that are idyllic, sobering, and poignant. Tommo thinks upon the role he played in his father's accidental death, the adventures that he shared with Charlie, his relationship with his childhood friend Molly, and the experiences that he has had since entering the war. Finally, he describes how Charlie disobeyed a direct order to stay with him after he was wounded in action, fully aware of this decision's dire consequences. While this story is not based on any one individual, Morpurgo has personalized the British tactic of executing their own soldiers "for cowardice or desertion," memorializing these men without passing judgment.

It is crucial for those considering divorce to anticipate what lies ahead in order to make informed decisions. Too often the fallout from divorce is far more devastating than many people realize when contemplating the move. This chapter outlines some of the common pitfalls of divorce to aid readers in decisions about their marriages.<br><br>The following is a letter written by a woman who read an article about my views on divorce in the <i>Los Angeles Times:</i><br><br>Dear Ms. Weiner-Davis:<br><br>My age is sixty-seven, and after nineteen years of a marriage that was impossible in my opinion, I did seek a divorce. I sincerely believed that my children and I would be better off if I got out of the marriage, and this was confirmed and encouraged by therapists. I should have tried harder to make our lives better. I should have changed myself more. I wish I knew then all the things I know now. It takes so long to attain wisdom, when it is needed when one is young.<br><br>I was forty and attractive and wanted to "grow," and did not like the way my children were, emotionally, living with the type of person their father was. I did what I thought was the best thing to do, at that time. And yes, I did think I would spend a year or so alone, remarry, and everything would be fine.<br><br>My children, who did not like their father, were nevertheless adversely affected over the years because of the divorce. They are now grown and have learned to accept him as he is. But damage was done. I "went out into the world" for the first time in my life and I did grow, learn, experience fantastic fun and loneliness as well. I eventually remarried and my marriage at this time is fine. But it took a lot of work to make it this way.<br><br>The article stirred up lots of feelings and doubts about what I thought for so long was "the right thing" to do -- divorce. Many years ago, a friend said to me that getting a divorce is like getting hit by a Mack truck. It is. For everyone involved.<br><br>My ex-husband has remarried and I believe his wife has difficulty coping with some of his idiosyncrasies but she accepts them and enjoys an otherwise good life with him. (I should have been wise enough to do the same.)<br><br>I am not thoroughly convinced that I did the wrong thing, but I am sorry that I did not get better counseling and give it more time before disrupting four lives (two children). Maybe the marriage could have been saved.<br><br>Mainly, I would like to applaud you and the other therapists on the new view of divorce. Divorce should only be done as a last resort, when all other efforts have been exhausted. For everyone's sake.<br><br>You should feel proud of the work you are doing. Congratulations.<br><br>Mary<br><br>I was very touched by this letter because it captured the feelings expressed by so many divorced people I've met over the years. In a desperate attempt to expand her own life and improve the quality of life for her children, she left her husband. Convinced this move would be best for all concerned, she made a decision that would change their lives. As she reflected on the outcome of her decision, she was not without regrets. Her second marriage taught her that all marriages require a commitment to work out differences since no partners are perfect; like any package deal, there are pluses and minuses. With painstaking honesty, she admitted the wisdom in accepting certain idiosyncrasies in one's spouse in order to enjoy "an otherwise good life with him" (as his new wife understands).<br><br>Her children taught her about the damaging effects of divorce despite her belief she was rescuing them from their unlikable father. Ironically, they eventually learned to "accept him as he is" anyway. Despite her personal gains from the divorce, she regretted not having given the marriage more time and gotten more support for staying married from the therapists she encountered along the way.<br><br><b>ARE WE FINALLY LEARNING?</b><br><br>Clearly, divorce supplied no magic solutions for Mary. It appears that more and more couples are beginning to take a skeptical view of divorce. In fact, something remarkable happened in 1982: For the first time in twenty-five years the divorce rate dropped, after having first leveled off for one year. The National Center for Health Statistics indicated that the 1989 rates were down 4 percent from 1988. This decline followed an unprecedented rise in the number of divorces in our country from 1960 through 1980.<br><br>Why the decrease; what's going on? There are many theories. Some say the growing threat of AIDS is keeping couples together or that more couples are separating but not divorcing to spare themselves legal costs. However, my explanation is different. I believe that people are beginning to realize how devastating divorce is -- emotionally, financially and spiritually -- for everyone involved. With enough time under our belts to have observed the results of rampant divorce, we are beginning to recognize the price we have paid for the freedom of disposable marriages.<br><br>My conclusion -- that divorce is not the answer -- is based on more than a decade of observation of clients, friends and family who have opted to divorce and on input from many of my colleagues who work with couples and families. In regard to divorce, this is what I have learned:<br><br><b>1. DIVORCE DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IT IS MEANT TO SOLVE</b><br><br>There are primarily two reasons people divorce. One is to escape a relationship that has been painful, loveless or destructive. The second is to seek a more satisfying life with a new partner or alone. As you will see in this chapter, these goals are not always accomplished through divorce. Some people do go on to enhance their lives, but the price they pay is often higher than anticipated.<br><br>Few adults anticipate accurately what lies ahead when they decide to divorce. Life is almost always more arduous and more complicated than they expect. It is often more depleting and more lonely for at least one member of the marriage. At the time of divorce, people are intent on getting rid of their unhappiness, and they find it difficult to conjure up understanding for something they have never experienced. It is hard for them to imagine the multiple changes that divorce will bring in its wake. Eventually they do learn, however, that the changes we make from divorce are hard-won. (Wallerstein and Blakeslee, 1989.)<br><br><b>"If It Weren't for You, I'd Be Happy"</b><br><br>Desperately unhappy people search for ways out of their unhappiness. They start by trying to determine the cause of their misery. As they look around, married people often see their spouse as the culprit. Blaming your spouse for your unhappiness is easy to do. Everyone does it, often supported in this kind of thinking by friends and relatives. "I would be happier if he were more attentive"; "If she didn't nag so much, I would enjoy my life"; "He's gone so much, of course I'm miserable" are some of the more common spousal complaints. Underlying each of these statements is the belief that the person's unhappiness is caused by his or her mate. Logic then dictates that divorce is the solution: "If I get rid of my spouse, I will get rid of this problem and then I will be happy."<br><br>Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. People are shocked to discover that their difficulties continue to hound them in spite of their single status or their choice of a new partner. Some disillusioned divorced people tell me, "My spouse's habits really irritated me, but now I can't cope with this loneliness. The silence in the evenings is killing me." Or "The new guy I married seemed so sensitive and open, the qualifies I missed in my first marriage, but as I've gotten to know him better he now seems more like a clone of my first husband." Or "I thought leaving my wife and all of her demands would make me happy, but oddly enough I am still unhappy."<br><br>As you will learn from this book, diagnosing your spouse as the problem means that your microscope lens may be too narrowly focused. You are failing to notice how the habits you <i>both</i> have developed and the roles you've <i>both</i> played have contributed to your unworkable marriage. Unfortunately, you take those habits with you when you go.<br><br>If getting rid of one's problematic spouse was a solution, why would 60 percent of second marriages end in divorce? If divorce were truly an answer, people would learn from the mistakes they made in their first marriage. Their second marriage would provide them with opportunities to apply what they learned. Sometimes this is the case, but more frequently, people are not prepared for the complexities of second marriages or blended families. Sometimes the trials and tribulations of the previous marriage with all its aggravation seem mild by comparison. But the results of this sort of comparison come too late. People discover that the grass isn't any greener on the other side after all. Then the decision to divorce a second time is often less agonizing since there's familiarity with the process.<br><br><b>"If It Weren't for You, There Would Be No More Arguments"</b><br><br>Many people leave their marriages expecting the arguments to stop. Divorce does offer a temporary reprieve from the tension and/or arguing, but when children are involved, marital debates frequently <i>do not</i> cease with the divorce decree. I have worked with divorced couples unable to resolve child-custody, visitation and child-rearing issues. They give new meaning to the words "hostile" and "angry." That these two human beings once shared a cordial or loving relationship is almost unthinkable because all that remains of their shared history is hatred.<br><br>What also continues to amaze me is how even many years of physical separation fail to free these couples from intense emotional bonds. Their inability to resolve certain child-rearing issues reflects their inability to let go of each other.<br><br>Debra and Thomas, a divorced couple, arrived in my office for divorce mediation since they were unable to resolve major disagreements over the visitation schedule. Like many couples needing mediation, Debra and Thomas's interactions were characterized by animosity and lack of respect. Even when addressing each other, they maintained eye contact with me. They frequently interrupted each other with accusations or alternative versions of the truth. When I requested that each person be allowed to speak uninterrupted, "loud" grimaces took the place of verbal attacks.<br><br>Although I kept them focused on the task at hand, finding solutions to the visitation problems, eventually the conversation turned to the disappointment they felt about unmet needs in the marriage. Debra wept as she told of her close relationship with her father and how Thomas failed to live up to the memories she had of her childhood with her dad. Thomas felt that Debra never really respected him due to their cultural and socioeconomic differences. He thought he was never good enough in the eyes of Debra's family. The sadness of their failed relationship was fresh for both of them though they had been divorced for five years.<br><br>What upset Debra the most was that, since the time of their divorce and Thomas's subsequent marriage to Sue, Thomas was taking a more active parenting role. Now each time Thomas sought more contact with the children, instead of feeling pleased for the children that they were important to their dad, she felt betrayed and manipulated. "Why, if the children are so important to you, didn't you make time for them when we were married?" she challenged him. His requests for increased visitation were often denied because of her resentment over thwarted dreams.<br><br>Thomas never took Debra's criticism about his priorities seriously when they were married because, according to him, Debra criticized him about everything. Debra's pleas for more involvement with the children were seen as just one more item on Debra's long laundry list of Thomas's inadequacies. So Thomas had resisted more involvement with the children, not because he didn't love them or want to be with them, but because of the tug-of-war with Debra. Once separated from her, he missed the children and saw that his relationship with them was important to him. This explained his recent desire to spend more time with them.<br><br>Although an agreement about visitation was reached during that session, Debra left crying. I believe she cried all the way home. Thomas also showed signs of feeling drained emotionally. They both had hoped that their divorce would free them from disappointment, arguments about the children and criticisms of each other, none of which happened. Clearly, their unresolved relationship issues kept them super-glued to each other, making it impossible for them to cooperate as parents.<br><br>If you have children and are considering divorce, you must remember that your spouse will <i>always</i> be your children's parent, no matter what you do. Unless he or she decides to sever ties entirely, you will continue to have contact with that person for the rest of your life! This contact serves as a constant reminder of the past. Children can also be ghosts of failed marriages when, because of their looks or personalities, they remind a parent of an estranged spouse. This can have deadly consequences for the parent-child relationship.<br><br><b>2. DIVORCE CREATES NEW PROBLEMS</b><br><br>When people divorce they have visions of better lives. Old problems will vanish, they hope, as new dreams take their place. These dreams usually include meeting candidates for more intimate relationships, more compatible sexual partners, improved financial status, more freedom to pursue personal goals and new opportunities to make independent choices. As explained above, these dreams frequently do not materialize, creating a whole new set of problems. Even when desired changes do occur, they are not without unintended or unexpected consequences. Let us take a look at some frequent but unexpected consequences of divorce.<br><br><b>Money Matters</b><br><br>If you are a woman, the statistics are bleak. Lenore Weitzman, a sociologist who conducted an extensive study of divorced families, wrote in her book <i>The Divorce Revolution</i> that one year after divorce, women's standard of living decreases by 73 percent while men's increases by 42 percent. Furthermore, alimony is a thing of the past. Women seldom are awarded it. Weitzman writes:<br><br>These apparently simple statistics have far-reaching social and economic consequences. For most women and children, divorce means precipitous downward mobility -- both economically and socially. The reduction in income brings residential moves and inferior housing, drastically diminished or nonexistent funds for recreation and leisure, and intense pressures due to inadequate time and money. (Quoted in Berman, 1991, p. 57.)<br><br>Unfortunately, all too often, effects of changing financial status are overlooked, minimized or denied.<br><br><b>Where Is Mr. Right?</b><br><br>There are other disadvantages to being a newly divorced woman. According to the Census Bureau, divorced women are far less likely to remarry than divorced men. Forty percent of the women who divorce after age thirty do not remarry. A portion of those who do not remarry may do so by choice, but many say that the pool of marriage-minded men available to these women has been shrinking. It seems that many men in similar age brackets are marrying younger women.<br><br>Imagine how shocking it is to the woman who leaves a marriage hoping to find intimacy and romance in the perfect new mate and finds herself alone instea...</p><h2>World War II: A New History</h2><p>This is a revised and updated edition of Evan Mawdsley&#39;s acclaimed global history of World War II.

D. Salinger. Precariously balanced between poverty and glamour, she spends her days in a plush, wood-paneled office&#x2014;where Dictaphones and typewriters still reign and agents doze after three-martini lunches&#x2014;and then goes home to her threadbare Brooklyn apartment and her socialist boyfriend. Rakoff is tasked with processing Salinger&#x2019;s voluminous fan mail, but as she reads the heart-wrenching letters from around the world, she becomes reluctant to send the agency&#x2019;s form response and impulsively begins writing back. The results are both humorous and moving, as Rakoff, while acting as the great writer&#x2019;s voice, begins to discover her own.<br></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2014:</strong> Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there existed a world in which writers used typewriters, publishers and agents sent manuscripts (on paper!) via the U.S. Postal Service, and starry-eyed ambitious young people moved to New York to try their luck in the literary world. (Okay, so that last bit still holds true.) It was the late &#x2018;90s when writer-to-be Joanna Rakoff got her first job in New York publishing as an assistant to the woman who represented the great reclusive author J.D. Salinger. In the winsome and meticulously observed <em>My Salinger Year</em>, Rakoff recounts her experiences as an earlier-era Lena Dunham-creation, complete with a ratty Brooklyn apartment, strident anti-establishment boyfriend, and big, <em>big</em> dreams. &#x201c;We all have to start somewhere,&#x201d; is how Rakoff begins her story of being young, gifted, and possessed of a coveted &#x201c;editorial assistant&#x201d; job that her parents (my parents, your parents, everyone&#x2019;s parents) would call &#x201c;secretary.&#x201d; While it&#x2019;s true that J.D. &#x201c;Jerry&#x201d; Salinger figures into the narrative--and rather sympathetically so--it&#x2019;s a mistake to say he&#x2019;s at the heart of it. Youth, adventure, hope, ambition, and a keen eye and ear are what make this book run; with it, Rakoff--author of the novel <em>A Fortunate Age</em>--takes her place among such illustrious coming-of-age-in-New-York writers as Sylvia Plath, Candace Bushnell, and, well, maybe even J.D. Salinger. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Joanna Rakoff&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>A Fortunate Age</i>&nbsp;won the Goldberg Prize for Jewish Fiction by Emerging Writers and the <i>Elle</i> Readers&#x2019; Prize, and was a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Editors&#x2019; Choice and a&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>&nbsp;best seller.

Winner of the three national Coach of the Year honors, the only coach ever to lead six different schools to season-ending bowl games, and the ninth-winningest coach in college football history, Holtz is still teaching and coaching, although he is no longer on the gridiron. </p><p>In his most telling work to date, the man still known as "Coach" by all who cross his path reveals what motivated a rail-thin 135-pound kid with marginal academic credentials and a pronounced speech impediment to play and coach college football, and to become one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in history. With unflinching honesty and his trademark dry wit, Holtz goes deep, giving us the intimate details of the people who shaped his life and the decisions he would make that shaped the lives of so many others.</p><p>His is a storied career, and Holtz provides a frank and inside look at the challenges he overcame to turn around the programs at William and Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, and Minnesota. From growing up in East Liverpool, Ohio, to his early days as a graduate assistant at the University of Iowa, to his national championship runs at Notre Dame and his final seasons on the sidelines in South Carolina, Lou Holtz gives his best, a poignant, funny, and instructive look into a life well lived. </p></p><p><p>After nearly three decades on the sidelines, Lou Holtz retired from coaching and now shares his strategies for success with Fortune 500 companies, groups, and organizations. He is the author of two bestsellers, <em>The Fighting Spirit</em> and <em>Winning Every Day</em>. He lives in Florida.</p>With a strong overtone of moral teaching, college football coaching legend Holtz offers a prosaic but endearing memoir. It's clear from the beginning that Holtz sees coaching as nurturing more than mere athletic achievement; it's an opportunity to mold promising student-athletes into superlative young men: "Coaching gives one a chance to be successful as well as significant." Holtz grew up in a hardscrabble West Virginia mining town in the 1940s and '50s, keeping a determinedly working-class and strictly religious attitude no matter how high he climbed as a coach. His stories of assistant and then head coaching at institutions from Ohio State to North Carolina State&#x2014;as well as run-ins with big names like Bill Cowherand Bill Clinton&#x2014;are full of funny anecdotes and neat little lessons, but they tend to blur in the mind. A standout is Holtz's long-term position at Notre Dame, of special importance not just because of his devout Catholicism but also his refreshing devotion to strict academic standards for the players. In fact, what stands out is his modesty and adamant belief that football is ultimately less important than education. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What is it like to work on a Friday night while the rest of the city is asleep? There&#x2019;s the smell of lilacs in the night air, the dusky highway in the moonlight, and glimpses of shy nighttime animals to make the dark magical. Shooting baskets in the half-lit gym, sweeping the stage with the game on the radio, and reading out loud to his father in the library all help the boy&#x2019;s time pass quickly.

But he is also quite aware of his destiny. Wakanda is a technologically advanced African land, once struck by a meteor that brought with it a material so strong it had no equal. The material, called Vibranium, is now a much-desired resource and there are many who would fight to possess its power. T'Challa's father, also known as the Black Panther, is King of Wakanda and the descendant of the great warrior Bashenga who protected the isolated nation from evil spirits when the meteor struck. Prompted by rumors of an invasion, his father summons T'Challa and tells him he will be sent away to Chicago along with his friend M'Baku. There, he will be safe until the uprising is settled.

Shomon, here is a holistic roadmap for diagnosis, treatment and recovery for the millions of people suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.</p> <p>There are an estimated 3 million-plus Americans suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism, and patient advocate Mary J. Shomon will guide them through the diagnosis and the wide-ranging treatments available. Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism are the result of the thyroid gland being overactive. This gland controls the body's metabolism, so people afflicted with the disorder can suffer from symptoms such as significant weight loss, fatigue, muscular weakness, and rapid heartbeat, among others. In addition to conventional treatments, this resource uniquely highlights holistic treatments, and through case studies and testimonials from patients and doctors, presents an honest look at the lifestyles and choices of people living with these conditions. </p> <p>Shomon presents the reader with a comprehensive resource that spans from diagnosis to treatment to life after treatment. She goes beyond the conventional advice of other books, utilizing patient anecdotes and, as a fellow thyroid disease patient, her own experience. Her extensive network of experts&#x2014;from conventional physicians to alternative practitioners&#x2014;allows for a wide range of treatment options. In addition, a comprehensive Appendix serves as a fantastic resource for patients seeking treatment and additional advice. </p><p>The first edition of <em>Living Well With Hypothyroidism</em> (2/2000)</p></p><p><p>Diagnosed with a thyroid disease in 1995, Mary J.

From the remotest air bases in the Pacific Command, where he discovered that the authority to initiate use of nuclear weapons was widely delegated, to the secret plans for general nuclear war under Eisenhower, which, if executed, would cause the near-extinction of humanity, Ellsberg shows that the legacy of this most dangerous arms buildup in the history of civilization--and its proposed renewal under the Trump administration--threatens our very survival. No other insider with high-level access has written so candidly of the nuclear strategy of the late Eisenhower and early Kennedy years, and nothing has fundamentally changed since that era.</p><p>Framed as a memoir--a chronicle of madness in which Ellsberg acknowledges participating--this gripping expos� reads like a thriller and offers feasible steps we can take to dismantle the existing "doomsday machine" and avoid nuclear catastrophe, returning Ellsberg to his role as whistle-blower. <i>The Doomsday Machine</i> is thus a real-life Dr. Strangelove story and an ultimately hopeful--and powerfully important--book about not just our country, but the future of the world.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2017:</strong> When Daniel Ellsberg was busy photocopying the Pentagon Papers&#x2014;the set of classified documents that outlined the actual scope of the Vietnam War, the scale and illegality of which was unknown to the American public&#x2014;he was also collecting information about the capabilities of the United States&#x2019; nuclear arsenal, in particular its philosophies and strategies regarding its use. Ellsberg, who worked in the highest levels of government crafting nuclear strategy before he became a whistleblower, lost those copies long ago, and for decades he held his knowledge close for fear of prosecution. But recent Freedom of Information Act disclosures have made him a little more comfortable in sharing his experience and information, and again, what he reveals that what we have been told&#x2014; that these devastating weapons only existed as a method of deterrence&#x2014;has never been true. Rather, the options of &#x201c;first strike&#x201d; or &#x201c;first use&#x201d; were, and are, always key components of American foreign strategy. That&#x2019;s just from the introduction of <em>The Doomsday Machine</em>; what follows is an astonishing behind-the-scenes collection of detailed descriptions of global near-calamities, flawed launch protocols (both the U.S.&#x2019;s military and our adversaries&#x2019;), and the government&#x2019;s own chilling estimates on the potential carnage following a nuclear conflict. At this moment especially, this book is terrifying. It&#x2019;s also impossible to put down. <em>--Jon Foro, Amazon Book Review</em>In 1961, <b>Daniel Ellsberg</b>, a consultant to the White House, drafted Secretary Robert McNamara's plans for nuclear war.

This book shows us how, in plain English. Hood Health is an anthology of health experts from urban communities throughout the Americas, offering practical health solutions. Topics include diet, exercise, psychological wellness, reproductive health, environmental toxins, urban survival, and budgeting. Over a dozen writers contributed to this handbook, edited by C BS Alife and Supreme Understanding. The contributors include fitness gurus, dieticians, personal trainers, and holistic practitioners from around the country. The completion of the text was supervised by a panel of licensed physicians. Black and Brown people in America are two to six times more likely to die from health-related complications than their white peers, even when you look at people whose income is the same. Why? What is happening in urban communities? And what can be done to change it? The answers are in this book. The Hood Health Handbook is a COMPREHENSIVE source of information and insight on EVERY health issue faced by the urban community. In plain language, the authors draw on well-known examples from urban culture to illustrate what works...and what doesn t. Focusing on natural and affordable alternatives to Western medicine, the authors provide recommendations that anyone can put to practice. Don t wait to pick this book up until it s too late. Volume One focuses on the status of health in the urban community, the &#34;wrong foods&#34; that make us unhealthy, the history of diet and healthcare among Black and brown people (focusing on how things changed for the worst), the diseases and illnesses that plague our communities, and holistic (natural) methods to heal and treat ourselves into wellness. Volume Two focuses on other essentials outside of diet (rest, water, sunlight, and more), hygiene, mental health, emotional health, health issues specific to women, having and raising healthy children, maintaining a clean and healthy household, and how to avoid the dangerous toxins in our food and environment.</p><p>Collectively, The Hood Health Handbook features over 120 informative and practical articles, including contributions from hiphop artist and nutritionist Supa Nova Slom; physician and medical fraud expert Dr. Scott Whitaker; vegan chef Bryant Terry; hiphop artist and fitness expert Stic.man; chef and holistic health counselor, Afya Ibomu; expert on law and healthcare disparities Dr. Vernellia Randall; hiphop artist and activist, Wise Intelligent; detox expert and educator Dr. Nancy Williams; naturopathic doctor and skin care consultant, Dr. Kanika Jamila and the world-renowned Dick Gregory.</p><h2>Psalm Twenty-Three</h2><p>Through poignant, heart-warming images of an urban African-American family, children experience the comfort and encouragement this favorite psalm still offers &#x2014; the powerful message that they can rely on the Lord as they thread their way through the risk-filled maze of daily life in the city.</p><p>When he was eight years old, Tim lost an eye in anaccident. During his recovery, his father gave him oilpaints, a couple of brushes, and a small canvas. He painteda clown with colors straight from the tube. Tim&#39;s firstwork was promptly framed, and his love of painting wasborn.Ages 4-8. The love, fear, and faith of one of the most beautiful psalms find expression in a picture book set in a contemporary urban neighborhood. Glowing, realistic paintings of two African American children in a warm extended family illustrate the lines of the psalm, taking the kids through one day from early morning to night. The children wake in a joyful, loving home ("The Lord is my shepherd"); have fun with their friends in the playground; receive devoted attention from their teachers ("He guides me in paths of righteousness"); and return to food and shelter ("You prepare a table before me"). But the scene is bleak. They must walk to school and back through "the valley of the shadow of death," where menacing figures lounge in wait in shadowy, crowded streets. While they eat dinner in the light, the darkness outside their window is filled with violence. The slightly modernized text is less poetic than the King James Version. The pages are so tightly bound that you miss part of the middle of each double-page-spread illustration, and that's too bad because the pictures make extraordinary use of light and perspective, showing that the children are being watched with loving attention. In a final painting, they are asleep, the window above their bed transformed into a stained-glass vision of the Lord who is their shepherd. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Cults Inside Out: How People Get In and Can Get Out</h2><p><p>You&#x2019;ve seen them in movies and on TV, but cults are more prevalent than you think&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re armed with strategies that can brainwash and persuade even the most unlikely of candidates. </p> <p>But how do individuals get involved with cults in the first place, and what steps can be taken to &#x201c;deprogram&#x201d; and heal those who have been drawn into these damaging groups?</p> <p>These questions and more are addressed in <i>Cults Inside Out</i>, written by leading cult expert Rick Alan Ross.

The classic text revised and updated</h2><p>Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a simple, natural method of allowing the mind to go beyond thoughts and gain access to the silent inner field of creativity, energy, peace, and happiness that is our own essential nature, our Self. Widely known and prescribed by physicians for its powerful stress-reducing effects, TM is much more than that. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1918&#x2013;2008), who brought TM to the West, said that TM offers any individual not only a gateway to the highest spiritual unfoldment (Enlightenment), but also "sound physical and mental health, greater ability in action, a greater capacity to think clearly, increased efficiency in work, and more loving and rewarding relationships with others." Five million TM practitioners around the world and more than 360 published, peer-reviewed scientific studies have consistently corroborated these lofty claims. Described as "a great book, by far the most comprehensive on the TM Program" when it was a bestseller in its original version, Jack Forem&#x2019;s study of TM became a much-loved classic. This updated edition contains all the features of the original plus much more. Clear, easy-to-read diagrams explain scientific research showing TM&#x2019;s beneficial effect on the brain and a broad spectrum of contemporary concerns, from health, self-actualization, and development of intelligence to post-traumatic stress (PTSD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and much more. In these pages, Oprah Winfrey tells how she has offered TM to everyone on her staff. Dr. Mehmet Oz explains the benefits of TM for heart health. School principals describe the dramatically positive effect on their students when TM is introduced in the classroom. Interviews with celebrities as well as men and women of every age, background, and religion provide a lively testimonial to the efficacy of TM in making anyone&#x2019;s life happier, healthier, and more creative.</p><p>Jack Forem met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and learned Transcendental Meditation in late 1966. After studying with Maharishi in India in 1970, Forem served as head of the TM center in New York and on Maharishi&#x2019;s International Staff; taught training courses for TM teachers in Europe; led conferences and seminars on the development of creativity, leadership, and higher states of consciousness; and wrote a best-selling book on Maharishi and TM."I love Transcendental Meditation!

Rarely does an expositor demonstrate such virtuosity. But Iain Duguid brings it all together: a specialist's knowledge of the Hebrew text and culture, a preacher's eye for theme and structure, a pastor's skill in nuanced application, a theologian's grasp of Christ-centered theology (that would make Geerhardus Vos smile), and a wordsmith's attention to language and lingering metaphor.

Her collected food stories, folklore and remedies, and the related recipes food professor Fred Opie pairs with them, are essential reading for those who love to cook and eat.</p><p>Frederick Douglass Opie is a professor of history and foodways at Babson College and the author of several books including Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America,&#34; &#34;Black Labor Migration in Caribbean Guatemala, 1882-1923&#34; and &#34;Upsetting the Apple Cart: Black and Latino Coalitions in New York From Protest to Public Office.&#34; Opie is a regular contributor on the radio show The Splendid Table and the editor of the popular food and history blog foodasalens.com.&#34;</p><h2>Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means</h2><p><p>Bureaucracy, confusing paperwork, and complex regulations&#x2014;or what public policy scholars Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan call administrative burdens&#x2014;often introduce delay and frustration into our experiences with government agencies. Administrative burdens diminish the effectiveness of public programs and can even block individuals from fundamental rights like voting. In <i>Administrative</i><i>Burden</i>, Herd and Moynihan document that the administrative burdens citizens regularly encounter in their interactions with the state are not simply unintended byproducts of governance, but the result of deliberate policy choices. Because burdens affect people&#x2019;s perceptions of government and often perpetuate long-standing inequalities, understanding why administrative burdens exist and how they can be reduced is essential for maintaining a healthy public sector.<br> <br> Through in-depth case studies of federal programs and controversial legislation, the authors show that administrative burdens are the nuts-and-bolts of policy design. Regarding controversial issues such as voter enfranchisement or abortion rights, lawmakers often use administrative burdens to limit access to rights or services they oppose. For instance, legislators have implemented administrative burdens such as complicated registration requirements and strict voter-identification laws to suppress turnout of African American voters. Similarly, the right to an abortion is legally protected, but many states require women seeking abortions to comply with burdens such as mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds, and scripted counseling. As Herd and Moynihan demonstrate, administrative burdens often disproportionately affect the disadvantaged who lack the resources to deal with the financial and psychological costs of navigating these obstacles.<br> <br> However, policymakers have sometimes reduced administrative burdens or shifted them away from citizens and onto the government. One example is Social Security, which early administrators of the program implemented in the 1930s with the goal of minimizing burdens for beneficiaries. As a result, the take-up rate is about 100 percent because the Social Security Administration keeps track of peoples&#x2019; earnings for them, automatically calculates benefits and eligibility, and simply requires an easy online enrollment or visiting one of 1,200 field offices. Making more programs and public services operate this efficiently, the authors argue, requires adoption of a nonpartisan, evidence-based metric for determining when and how to institute administrative burdens, with a bias toward reducing them. By ensuring that the public&#x2019;s interaction with government is no more onerous than it need be, policymakers and administrators can reduce inequality, boost civic engagement, and build an efficient state that works for all citizens.<br> </p></p><p><b>Pamela Herd</b> is a Professor in the&nbsp;McCourt&nbsp;School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Donald Moynihan</b> is the inaugural McCourt&nbsp;Chair in the&nbsp;McCourt&nbsp;School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Citizens routinely experience government in their everyday lives, and too often such encounters impose cumbersome challenges and reinforce inequality. In this clearly written and powerfully argued book, Pamela Herd and Donald P. Moynihan argue that these &#x2018;administrative burdens&#x2019; are political tactics, strategically applied to policies by political leaders who aim to restrict access to rights and benefits. Change is possible, however, as demonstrated by policies in which more effective and efficient procedures have been adopted. This captivating and important book is a &#x2018;must read&#x2019; for anyone who wants to see government operate better in serving citizens.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;SUZANNE METTLER, John L.

Social security, driver's license, nursing certification: It all checks out. And it sounds like she did a good job for her former employers. So Kinsey gives her the thumbs-up, figuring Gus will be the ideal assignment for this diligent, experienced caregiver.<br><br>And the real Solana Rojas was indeed an excellent caregiver. But the woman who has stolen her identity is not, and for her, Gus will be the ideal victim...<br><br><b>&#x201c;The best and strongest book in the series...Solana is one of the most evil, calculating characters Grafton has created.&#x201d;&#x2014;*<i>USA Today</i></b></p><p>#1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author&nbsp;<b>Sue Grafton&nbsp;</b>first introduced Kinsey Millhone in the Alphabet Series in 1982. Soon after, both writer and heroine became icons and international bestsellers. Ms. Grafton was a writer who consistently broke the bonds of genre while never writing the same book twice. Named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, her awards and honors included the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, the Ross Macdonald Literary Award, the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award from Britain's Crime Writers' Association, the Lifetime Achievement Award from Malice Domestic,&nbsp;a Lifetime Achievement Award from Bouchercon, three Shamus Awards, and three Anthony Awards&#x2014;including the first two ever awarded. She passed away in December 2017.Judy Kaye simply is Kinsey Millhone. When Kinsey is on her daily run, Judy is short of breath. When Kinsey is being strangled by a 300-pound sociopath, Judy can barely force air through her throat. Kaye, who has narrated all of Grafton�s Alphabet series, has the task nicely down pat. In addition to Kinsey, she creates many believable female characters, and her men are distinct (if a bit light-voiced). In this, the twentieth novel in the series, Kinsey is living in 1988. Yet the topics are thoroughly up-to-date: identity theft and abuse of the elderly. Fans of the series will be comforted to find that not much has changed in Santa Teresa.

He stared down at the boy in the red zip-up jacket and shook his shaved head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bring that thing in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fifty or so teenagers in line outside the Pandemonium Club leaned forward to eavesdrop. It was a long wait to get into the all-ages club, especially on a Sunday, and not much generally happened in line. The bouncers were fierce and would come down instantly on anyone who looked like they were going to start trouble. Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray, standing in line with her best friend, Simon, leaned forward along with everyone else, hoping for some excitement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, come on.&#x201d; The kid hoisted the thing up over his head. It looked like a wooden beam, pointed at one end. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of my costume.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bouncer raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Which is what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy grinned. He was normal-enough-looking, Clary thought, for Pandemonium. He had electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around his head like the tentacles of a startled octopus, but no elaborate facial tattoos or big metal bars through his ears or lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire hunter.&#x201d; He pushed down on the wooden thing. It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fake. Foam rubber. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy&#x2019;s wide eyes were way too bright a green, Clary noticed: the color of antifreeze, spring grass. Colored contact lenses, probably. The bouncer shrugged, abruptly bored. &#x201c;Whatever. Go on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy slid past him, quick as an eel. Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders, the way he tossed his hair as he went. There was a word for him that her mother would have used&#x2014;insouciant.<br> <br>&#x201c;You thought he was cute,&#x201d; said Simon, sounding resigned. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary dug her elbow into his ribs, but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br><br> <br>Inside, the club was full of dry-ice smoke. Colored lights played over the dance floor, turning it into a multicolored fairyland of blues and acid greens, hot pinks and golds.<br> <br>The boy in the red jacket stroked the long razor-sharp blade in his hands, an idle smile playing over his lips. It had been so easy&#x2014;a little bit of a glamour on the blade, to make it look harmless. Another glamour on his eyes, and the moment the bouncer had looked straight at him, he was in. Of course, he could probably have gotten by without all that trouble, but it was part of the fun&#x2014;fooling the mundies, doing it all out in the open right in front of them, getting off on the blank looks on their sheeplike faces.<br> <br>Not that the humans didn&#x2019;t have their uses. The boy&#x2019;s green eyes scanned the dance floor, where slender limbs clad in scraps of silk and black leather appeared and disappeared inside the revolving columns of smoke as the mundies danced. Girls tossed their long hair, boys swung their leather-clad hips, and bare skin glittered with sweat. Vitality just poured off them, waves of energy that filled him with a drunken dizziness. His lip curled. They didn&#x2019;t know how lucky they were. They didn&#x2019;t know what it was like to eke out life in a dead world, where the sun hung limp in the sky like a burned cinder. Their lives burned as brightly as candle flames&#x2014;and were as easy to snuff out.<br> <br>His hand tightened on the blade he carried, and he had begun to step out onto the dance floor when a girl broke away from the mass of dancers and began walking toward him. He stared at her. She was beautiful, for a human&#x2014;long hair nearly the precise color of black ink, charcoaled eyes. Floor-length white gown, the kind women used to wear when this world was younger. Lace sleeves belled out around her slim arms. Around her neck was a thick silver chain, on which hung a dark red pendant the size of a baby&#x2019;s fist. He only had to narrow his eyes to know that it was real&#x2014;real and precious. His mouth started to water as she neared him. Vital energy pulsed from her like blood from an open wound. She smiled, passing him, beckoning with her eyes. He turned to follow her, tasting the phantom sizzle of her death on his lips.<br> <br>It was always easy. He could already feel the power of her evaporating life coursing through his veins like fire. Humans were so stupid. They had something so precious, and they barely safeguarded it at all. They threw away their lives for money, for packets of powder, for a stranger&#x2019;s charming smile. The girl was a pale ghost retreating through the colored smoke. She reached the wall and turned, bunching her skirt up in her hands, lifting it as she grinned at him. Under the skirt, she was wearing thigh-high boots.<br> <br>He sauntered up to her, his skin prickling with her nearness. Up close she wasn&#x2019;t so perfect: He could see the mascara smudged under her eyes, the sweat sticking her hair to her neck. He could smell her mortality, the sweet rot of corruption. Got you, he thought.<br> <br>A cool smile curled her lips. She moved to the side, and he could see that she was leaning against a closed door. NO ADMITTANCE&#x2014;STORAGE was scrawled across it in red paint. She reached behind her for the knob, turned it, slid inside. He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes, tangled wiring. A storage room. He glanced behind him&#x2014;no one was looking. So much the better if she wanted privacy.<br> <br>He slipped into the room after her, unaware that he was being followed.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Simon said, &#x201c;pretty good music, eh?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary didn&#x2019;t reply. They were dancing, or what passed for it&#x2014;a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens&#x2014;in a space between a group of teenage boys in metallic corsets, and a young Asian couple who were making out passionately, their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines. A boy with a lip piercing and a teddy bear backpack was handing out free tablets of herbal ecstasy, his parachute pants flapping in the breeze from the wind machine. Clary wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention to their immediate surroundings&#x2014;her eyes were on the blue-haired boy who&#x2019;d talked his way into the club. He was prowling through the crowd as if he were looking for something. There was something about the way he moved that reminded her of something . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;I, for one,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;am enjoying myself immensely.&#x201d;<br> <br>This seemed unlikely. Simon, as always, stuck out at the club like a sore thumb, in jeans and an old T-shirt that said MADE IN BROOKLYN across the front. His freshly scrubbed hair was dark brown instead of green or pink, and his glasses perched crookedly on the end of his nose. He looked less as if he were contemplating the powers of darkness and more as if he were on his way to chess club.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Clary knew perfectly well that he came to Pandemonium with her only because she liked it, that he thought it was boring. She wasn&#x2019;t even sure why it was that she liked it&#x2014;the clothes, the music made it like a dream, someone else&#x2019;s life, not her boring real life at all. But she was always too shy to talk to anyone but Simon.<br> <br>The blue-haired boy was making his way off the dance floor. He looked a little lost, as if he hadn&#x2019;t found whom he was looking for. Clary wondered what would happen if she went up and introduced herself, offered to show him around. Maybe he&#x2019;d just stare at her. Or maybe he was shy too. Maybe he&#x2019;d be grateful and pleased, and try not to show it, the way boys did&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d know. Maybe&#x2014;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy straightened up suddenly, snapping to attention, like a hunting dog on point. Clary followed the line of his gaze, and saw the girl in the white dress.<br> <br>Oh, well, Clary thought, trying not to feel like a deflated party balloon. I guess that&#x2019;s that. The girl was gorgeous, the kind of girl Clary would have liked to draw&#x2014;tall and ribbon-slim, with a long spill of black hair. Even at this distance Clary could see the red pendant around her throat. It pulsed under the lights of the dance floor like a separate, disembodied heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;that this evening DJ Bat is doing a singularly exceptional job. Don&#x2019;t you agree?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary rolled her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer; Simon hated trance music. Her attention was on the girl in the white dress. Through the darkness, smoke, and artificial fog, her pale dress shone out like a beacon. No wonder the blue-haired boy was following her as if he were under a spell, too distracted to notice anything else around him&#x2014;even the two dark shapes hard on his heels, weaving after him through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary slowed her dancing and stared. She could just make out that the shapes were boys, tall and wearing black clothes. She couldn&#x2019;t have said how she knew that they were following the other boy, but she did. She could see it in the way they paced him, their careful watchfulness, the slinking grace of their movements. A small flower of apprehension began to open inside her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Meanwhile,&#x201d; Simon added, &#x201c;I wanted to tell you that lately I&#x2019;ve been cross-dressing. Also, I&#x2019;m sleeping with your mom. I thought you should know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had reached the wall, and was opening a door marked NO ADMITTANCE. She beckoned the blue-haired boy after her, and they slipped through the door. It wasn&#x2019;t anything Clary hadn&#x2019;t seen before, a couple sneaking off to the dark corners of the club to make out&#x2014;but that made it even weirder that they were being followed.<br> <br>She raised herself up on tiptoe, trying to see over the crowd. The two guys had stopped at the door and seemed to be conferring with each other. One of them was blond, the other dark-haired. The blond one reached into his jacket and drew out something long and sharp that flashed under the strobing lights. A knife. &#x201c;Simon!&#x201d; Clary shouted, and seized his arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Simon looked alarmed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sleeping with your mom, you know. I was just trying to get your attention. Not that your mom isn&#x2019;t a very attractive woman, for her age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you see those guys?&#x201d; She pointed wildly, almost hitting a curvy black girl who was dancing nearby. The girl shot her an evil look. &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;sorry!&#x201d; Clary turned back to Simon. &#x201c;Do you see those two guys over there? By that door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon squinted, then shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are two of them. They were following the guy with the blue hair&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The one you thought was cute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s not the point. The blond one pulled a knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Simon stared harder, shaking his head. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly all business, Simon squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get one of the security guards. You stay here.&#x201d; He strode away, pushing through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary turned just in time to see the blond boy slip through the NO ADMITTANCE door, his friend right on his heels. She looked around; Simon was still trying to shove his way across the dance floor, but he wasn&#x2019;t making much progress. Even if she yelled now, no one would hear her, and by the time Simon got back, something terrible might already have happened. Biting hard on her lower lip, Clary started to wriggle through the crowd.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and smiled. What faint light there was in the storage room spilled down through high barred windows smeared with dirt. Piles of electrical cables, along with broken bits of mirrored disco balls and discarded paint cans littered the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabelle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice name.&#x201d; He walked toward her, stepping carefully among the wires in case any of them were live. In the faint light she looked half-transparent, bleached of color, wrapped in white like an angel. It would be a pleasure to make her fall. . . . &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you here before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re asking me if I come here often?&#x201d; She giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. There was some sort of bracelet around her wrist, just under the cuff of her dress&#x2014;then, as he neared her, he saw that it wasn&#x2019;t a bracelet at all but a pattern inked into her skin, a matrix of swirling lines.<br> <br>He froze. &#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t finish. She moved with lightning swiftness, striking out at him with her open hand, a blow to his chest that would have sent him down gasping if he&#x2019;d been a human being. He staggered back, and now there was something in her hand, a coiling whip that glinted gold as she brought it down, curling around his ankles, jerking him off his feet. He hit the ground, writhing, the hated metal biting deep into his skin. She laughed, standing over him, and dizzily he thought that he should have known. No human girl would wear a dress like the one Isabelle wore. She&#x2019;d worn it to cover her skin&#x2014;all of her skin.<br> <br>Isabelle yanked hard on the whip, securing it. Her smile glittered like poisonous water. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all yours, boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>A low laugh sounded behind him, and now there were hands on him, hauling him upright, throwing him against one of the concrete pillars. He could feel the damp stone under his back. His hands were pulled behind him, his wrists bound with wire. As he struggled, someone walked around the side of the pillar into his view: a boy, as young as Isabelle and just as pretty. His tawny eyes glittered like chips of amber. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;Are there any more with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy could feel blood welling up under the too-tight metal, making his wrists slippery. &#x201c;Any other what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on now.&#x201d; The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands, and his dark sleeves slipped down, showing the runes inked all over his wrists, the backs of his hands, his palms. &#x201c;You know what I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>Far back inside his skull, the shackled boy&#x2019;s second set of teeth began to grind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shadowhunter,&#x201d; he hissed.<br> <br>The other boy grinned all over his face. &#x201c;Got you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Clary pushed the door to the storage room open, and stepped inside. For a moment she thought it was deserted. The only windows were high up and barred; faint street noise came through them, the sound of honking cars and squealing brakes. The room smelled like old paint, and a heavy layer of dust covered the floor, marked by smeared shoe prints.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no one in here, she realized, looking around in bewilderment. It was cold in the room, despite the August heat outside. Her back was icy with sweat. She took a step forward, tangling her feet in electrical wires. She bent down to free her sneaker from the cables&#x2014;and heard voices. A girl&#x2019;s laugh, a boy answering sharply. When she straightened up, she saw them.<br> <br>It was as if they had sprung into existence between one blink of her eyes and the next. There was the girl in her long white dress, her black hair hanging down her back like damp seaweed. The two boys were with her&#x2014;the tall one with black hair like hers, and the smaller, fair one, whose hair gleamed like brass in the dim light coming through the windows high above. The fair boy was standing with his hands in his pockets, facing the punk kid, who was tied to a pillar with what looked like piano wire, his hands stretched behind him, his legs bound at the ankles. His face was pulled tight with pain and fear.<br> <br>Heart hammering in her chest, Clary ducked behind the nearest concrete pillar and peered around it.

An insider&#x2019;s view of what takes place behind the closed doors of agencies and drug companies, and the people tasked to protect the health of American children.</b><br><br>In 2000, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) carried out a secret mission to bury, skew, and manipulate data in six vaccine safety studies, in a coordinated effort to control the message that &#x201c;vaccines do not cause autism.&#x201d; They did so via secret meetings and backtesting health-care data. The CDC invested tens of millions of dollars in a foreign health-care data analytics startup run by Danish scientist Poul Thorsen, a move to ensure that no link ever surfaced. But fate had other ideas. The agency soon learned it couldn&#x2019;t control Thorsen. In 2011, the US Justice Department indicted him for the theft of more than $1 million of CDC grant money.<br><br><i>Master Manipulator</i> exposes the CDC&#x2019;s hidden agenda for the cover-up. Influenced by Big Pharma money, future high-paying jobs, and political lobbyists, CDC executives charted a course different than what the findings of earlier vaccine safety studies revealed. The CDC needed an outsider to &#x201c;flatten&#x201d; the results of the data, while building an exit strategy: a fall guy in case the secret plan was exposed. Thorsen fit the bill nicely, conducting studies overseas. But the CDC&#x2019;s plan backfired, as Thorsen took the money to the bank and the power went to his head. It would take years for his fraud scheme&#x2014;funneling CDC grant money to a Danish university and then back to a CDC bank account he controlled&#x2014;to play out.<br><br><i>Master Manipulator</i> is a true story of fraud and betrayal.

(25-pack)</h2><p><p><strong>Why Trust the Bible?</strong></p><p>Don&#x2019;t believe everything you read. Everybody knows that.</p><p>So why trust the Bible?</p><p>What can be known about its historical reliability?</p><p><strong>Doing History</strong></p><p>Even more than other religions, Christianity presents itself as history. At its heart, Christianity claims that something extraordinary happened in the course of time&#x2015;something concrete, real, and historical.</p><p>In the Bible, the New Testament declares that a man named Jesus was born to a virgin, claimed to be God, did miracles like walking on water and raising people from the dead, was crucified on a Roman cross, then rose from the dead and ascended into heaven to reign as King of the universe. Can we conclude confidently these things are true without simply presupposing the Bible is &#x201c;the Word of God&#x201d;?&nbsp;</p><p>One way to find out is to approach the New Testament as a collection of historical documents that speak for themselves. But are these documents truly reliable, historically speaking?&nbsp;</p><p>Answering that involves a series of questions.</p><p><strong>Are Our Bible Translations Accurate?</strong></p><p>Although translation from ancient languages is neither easy nor simple, scholars have been working at it for centuries. It really is possible for genuine, accurate, correct communication to occur through translation.</p><p>In the New Testament, there is only a small percentage of content that has proven difficult in translation. The best Bible translations acknowledge these places with a footnote.</p><p>Moreover, we can confidently say that not one major doctrine of orthodox Christianity rests on any disputed or uncertain passage. We know what the Bible says and what it means.</p><p><strong>Were the Original Sources Accurately Copied?</strong></p><p>As with other ancient books, the physical pieces of &#x201c;paper&#x201d; on which the original authors first wrote the New Testament have been lost to history. But we have thousands of other ancient writings (on papyrus, vellum, and parchment) with original-language text copied from each book of the Bible&#x2015;about 5,400 distinct pieces when it comes to the New Testament, many going back to the first three centuries. They allow us to reconstruct with a huge degree of confidence what the originals said. (By comparison, for Julius Caesar&#x2019;s <em>Gallic Wars</em> we have at most ten readable copies, the earliest of which dates nine hundred years after Caesar&#x2019;s time.)&nbsp;</p><p>By comparing ancient copies of New Testament content with each other, we find a remarkably stable history of copy-making. For a few passages there&#x2019;s genuine doubt about the original text, as reflected by a relatively large number of variations. The vast majority of these variations are minor, not affecting how we ultimately understand the Bible&#x2019;s meaning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Were These Originals Truly the Best Sources?</strong></p><p>But were these the right documents to be looking at in the first place? Were other &#x201c;Gospels&#x201d; out there telling a different but equally reliable story about Jesus?</p><p>Actually, the only Christian books dated confidently to the first century are the very ones that finally made up the New Testament&#x2015;most of them already recognized by Christians as authoritative by first century&#x2019;s end.</p><p>Not until about a hundred years later did books start showing up that departed significantly from New Testament teaching. Meanwhile, Christians had good, plausible, historically meaningful reasons for explaining why the books in our New Testament should be there while others shouldn&#x2019;t. The earlier documents were recognized as reliable witnesses to Jesus&#x2019;s life and teachings.</p><p><strong>Were the Original Authors Trustworthy?</strong></p><p>In their narratives, New Testament authors included verifiable details of real, historical facts. Close scrutiny makes clear that these authors weren&#x2019;t writing fiction, or perpetrating some hoax, or under any delusion. They obviously believed that what they wrote really happened. Nor were their writings hopelessly confused, contradictory, or filled with errors. Especially in modern centuries, the Bible has been subjected&nbsp;to scorching and detailed assault by skeptics, but every single alleged contradiction, inconsistency, and error has been met with plausible resolutions after patient study.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Were the Original Authors Mistaken?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So the Bible is a reliable historical record of what these authors believe happened. But did those things really happen?&nbsp;</p><p>After all, the Bible is filled with miracle stories that invite our natural skepticism. These miracles appear essential to the Bible&#x2019;s message, and their eyewitness accounts come across as far more plausible than miracles found in ancient myths and legends.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s here that one miracle in particular leaps out: the resurrection of Jesus. If biblical writers were genuinely mistaken about that, it&#x2019;s unlikely they were right about much else. If Jesus is still dead, he&#x2019;s assuredly not the &#x201c;Christ&#x201d; the Bible speaks of.&nbsp;</p><p>Here again, careful historical analysis reveals that what happened at Jesus&#x2019;s tomb couldn&#x2019;t have been his &#x201c;near death,&#x201d; nor some hoax or deception or mass hallucination involving his followers. Their confident insistence that they found his tomb empty and saw the risen Jesus&#x2015; a belief embraced even at cost of their lives&#x2015;is explained by only one possibility: Jesus was bodily, historically resurrected from the dead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reason to Believe&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because of that resurrection, Christians believe what Jesus said. And since Jesus himself endorsed the entire Old Testament and authorized the entire New Testament, Christians believe these writings are reliable and true.&nbsp;</p><p>To Christians, Jesus&#x2019;s resurrection means that anyone united to him by faith will be resurrected just as he was. They believe God fully accepted the sacrifice for sins Jesus offered on the cross as the more-than-sufficient payment for our moral debt. They believe Jesus now lives to guide his people on earth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Next Question&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the end, deciding whether the Bible is reliable is just a means toward a more important question: Is Jesus reliable?&nbsp;If you&#x2019;re not a Christian, let this discussion challenge you to consider: Who exactly is Jesus? Perhaps that question is best answered in something the apostle John said about his New Testament writings: &#x201c;These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name&#x201d; (John 20:31).&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Greg Gilbert</strong> (MDiv, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is senior pastor at Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky.

What she didn't anticipate was the ruthlessness of the Old Reader&#x2014;who can control magic and enter worlds through books. All the creatures she promised to liberate and protect are being threatened, and slowly all of Alice's defenses are being worn away. So when Ending (the giant cat-like creature who guards the magical labyrinth in Geryon's library) hints at a dangerous final solution, Alice jumps at the chance, no matter the cost to her life. She and her friends&#x2014;a fire sprite, Ashes the cat, and the other apprentice Readers she met during her previous adventures&#x2014;go on a quest to free the one creature possibly strong enough to overturn the Old Readers once and for all.<br><br> But before it&#x2019;s all over, Alice will be betrayed, her true identity will be revealed, and she&#x2019;ll have to be willing to give up the person she loves the most. <br> &nbsp;<br> This is beautifully written, classic, bold historical fantasy&#x2014;brave, bloody, action-packed and adventurous&#x2014;with a girl at the center.</p><p>Django Wexler is a self-proclaimed computer/fantasy/sci-fi geek.

Though it hung alone in the emptiness, Alice knew it was enormous, as big across as she was tall. It focused on her, the great pupil narrowing, and in its gaze she felt something inscrutable and alien.</p><p>And yet she felt no fear. Instead, staring back into the abyss, she felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. warmth. Kindness. <i>Love.</i></p><p>A voice in her mind, strange and familiar all at once.</p><p><b>Alice.</b></p><p>She sat bolt upright in bed, sheets tangled around her feet. Her cheeks were slick with sweat, and her heart pounded.</p><p>She was in the room that her master Geryon had given her when she&#x2019;d first arrived on his estate, a dingy third-floor bedroom fit for a servant. It felt like home, now, if anywhere did. She knew every crack of the peeling paint, the smell of old wood and freshly laundered sheets, and the endless creaks and groans of the ancient building. Two stuffed rabbits, all that she&#x2019;d been allowed to carry away from her father&#x2019;s old house, sat on the windowsill like sentinels.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t have to stay in this room if she didn&#x2019;t want to. Geryon was right where Alice had put him&#x2014;bound inside <i>The Infinite Prison,</i> lost in an endless sea of mirror images. There was no one to tell Alice where to sleep, where to go, what to do. It should have been freeing, but she felt more hemmed in than ever. Instead of Geryon&#x2019;s orders restraining her, now an iron cage of <i>responsibility</i> squeezed her ever more tightly.</p><p>There was no chance of getting back to sleep. Alice waited until her heart slowed, then swung out of bed and stretched her aching legs. A surprisingly loud growl from her stomach reminded her that she&#x2019;d missed dinner, again.</p><p><i>If I&#x2019;m going to be awake, I might as well get something to eat.</i> It was still hours before dawn, but in Geryon&#x2019;s house the kitchen never closed. Alice shuffled into her slippers and opened the door to her room, carefully.</p><p>The house, which had felt empty for so long, now had several dozen inhabitants. The rooms immediately around hers were taken by the other apprentices, the friends who&#x2019;d thrown in their lot with her after facing the Ouroborean. She passed their doors quietly: Isaac, her oldest friend, who&#x2019;d once stolen the Dragon&#x2019;s book for his master. Dex, inveterate optimist, who&#x2019;d fought beside her in Esau&#x2019;s fortress. Jen and Michael, younger than Alice, devoted to each other, the former fierce and the latter cautious.</p><p>Down the corridors were others, magical creatures from Geryon&#x2019;s library who&#x2019;d begged her for shelter. As the labyrinthine Ending, the library&#x2019;s guardian, fought back the attacks of the old Readers, the once-peaceful library had become a war zone. Some of the inhabitants had retreated to their books, but many creatures in the library didn&#x2019;t have that option because their own worlds had become hostile, and had nowhere else to go. These refugees&#x2014;sprites, the mushroom-people called Enoki, and stranger things&#x2014;had taken up residence in the empty bedrooms of Geryon&#x2019;s manor house.</p><p>The kitchen was built on the same massive scale as the rest of the house, with acres of long wooden tables and ovens big enough to roast an ox. It was normally empty, since all the work was done by efficient, invisible servants who moved only when you turned your back. Tonight, though, Alice wasn&#x2019;t the only nocturnal visitor. Isaac sat at one of the long tables, in front of a jug of milk and a plate piled high with pastries.</p><p>&#x201c;Knock-knock,&#x201d; Alice said, coming through the open doorway. Isaac looked up with exactly the guilty expression she&#x2019;d pictured, which made her grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who were you expecting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I honestly don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Isaac sighed. &#x201c;Half the time I still wake up expecting to find my master&#x2014;my&nbsp;<i>former</i> master looking down at me.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice&#x2019;s grin faded. He looked tired and pale, worn out, the same things she saw in her own face when she looked in the mirror. Wearing only a nightshirt and trousers, without his voluminous trench coat, he seemed smaller than usual, more vulnerable. His brown hair was growing out, flopping in unruly curls down the back of his neck.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to eat all of those,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;or can you spare a few?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; He pushed the plate toward her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t seem to get this place to understand that I just want a snack.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice sat beside him. Another cup had appeared on the table the moment she looked away, and a fresh jug of ice-cold milk. She poured, and took a pastry. They were flaky and warm, filled with raspberry jam.</p><p>If Geryon had died, all of this&#x2014;everything that made the house&nbsp;<i>work</i>, the hidden creatures who fixed the food and did the laundry&#x2014;would have ground to a halt, like a watch with its mainspring removed. She&#x2019;d seen that in Esau&#x2019;s fortress, the gradual unraveling of a Reader&#x2019;s domain after their power vanished. By trapping her old master alive, she&#x2019;d kept the house running. She&#x2019;d also hoped to conceal what had happened from the other old Readers.</p><p>That part, unfortunately, hadn&#x2019;t worked.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;ve had a long day,&#x201d; Alice said as Isaac drained his cup and reached for another pastry.</p><p>&#x201c;You might say that.&#x201d; Isaac yawned. &#x201c;Michael and I were working with the swamp sprites on our plan to evacuate the house in an emergency.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t seem to be able to grasp the concept of moving in a straight line,&#x201d; Isaac said. &#x201c;And they kept turning the ground underneath me to mud, which isn&#x2019;t as funny the fourth or fifth time.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice winced. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought they were getting it by the end,&#x201d; Isaac said, staring at the pastry. &#x201c;But I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it really going to make a difference?&#x201d; He looked pained, as though the words were a betrayal. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all well and good to make plans to keep people safe, but in the end what is it going to actually accomplish? It won&#x2019;t keep the old Readers from coming to squash us flat. It won&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; He broke off, shaking his head, and looked up at Alice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m just tired.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice&#x2019;s stomach churned. The problem, of course, was that Isaac was right.</p><p>A month ago, she&#x2019;d trapped Geryon in&nbsp;<i>The Infinite Prison</i>, hoping the old Readers wouldn&#x2019;t find out. But they had. Alarmed, they had unleashed the Ouroborean, an ancient weapon, in an attempt to destroy her. With the help of her friends, she&#x2019;d defeated it, and afterward, she&#x2019;d told the apprentices and magical creatures that she intended to stand up to the old Readers, to pull down their whole poisonous order once and for all. Only days later, the attacks had begun. The other labyrinthine forced open some portals into the library to bring the creatures of the old Readers through.</p><p>Since then, defending against these attacks had occupied all of Alice&#x2019;s attention. The refugees from the library had to be protected, and she&#x2019;d organized them to help as much they were able. Ending did her best, but the other labyrinthine assaulted her constantly, and she had to conserve her strength. The task of hunting down attackers &#x2014;beast-like monsters, for the most part, driven into a rage by cruel magic&#x2014;fell to Alice and her friends. She&#x2019;d worked hard to make sure everyone knew what to do when an assault came, and so far they&#x2019;d had only a few injuries among the library creatures.</p><p>But it couldn&#x2019;t last. <i>It&#x2019;s not like the old Readers are going to run out of monsters.</i> They would keep coming until Ending&#x2019;s strength failed, and something&nbsp;<i>really</i> nasty managed to get through, or until Alice and her little squad of defenders were worn down and tired out.&nbsp;<i>We&#x2019;re not going to win.</i></p><p>She&#x2019;d hoped&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>I hoped for a lot of things.</i> More&nbsp;<i>time,</i> first and foremost. <i>There has to be a way to take the fight to them, but it&#x2019;s no good if we can barely protect ourselves.</i></p><p>Some of her thoughts must have shown on her face, because Isaac put his hand on the table between them, stretching toward her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be okay. We&#x2019;re holding our own.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice put her hand on his, and their fingers interlocked. She made herself smile. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to complain,&#x201d; Isaac said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>There was a thump from the doorway. They both looked up, and Alice&#x2019;s mental grasp automatically went to the threads of magic at the back of her mind, which linked her to her bound creatures. The Swarm for toughness, Spike for strength, and&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Soranna!&#x201d; she said, letting the power slip away.</p><p>The girl was leaning heavily on the door frame. When she pushed away from it and took a stumbling step forward, Alice could see she was filthy, her rough clothes caked with dirt and sweat. A bandage was wound around her thigh, and one side of her shirt was brown and crusty with dried blood.</p><p>Alice was vaulting the table before she knew it, sweeping past the stunned Isaac and hurrying to the girl&#x2019;s side. As Alice took hold of her arm, all the strength seemed to go out of Soranna. Alice half carried her to one of the benches, and Soranna leaned back against the table, eyes closed and breathing hard.</p><p>Soranna was another of the apprentices who&#x2019;d been with Alice in Esau&#x2019;s fortress and the fight against his labyrinthine, Torment. Alice hadn&#x2019;t seen her since&#x2014;she hadn&#x2019;t been among the group that had come after Geryon&#x2019;s imprisonment, and Alice hadn&#x2019;t figured out how to contact her. Now she was here, and hurt badly.</p><p>&#x201c;Soranna, what happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. someone,&#x201d; Isaac said, lurching to his feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Dex,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;No, get Magda the bone witch, if you can find her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d; Isaac looked relieved to be given a task. Before he could leave, though, Soranna opened her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x201d; she said, her voice a croak. &#x201c;Have to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell Alice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s coming?&#x201d;</p><p>Soranna blinked and turned to look at her, a smile spreading across her face. She coughed, and winced as if in pain.</p><p>&#x201c;Sunhawks,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sent. Sunhawks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ending would have called us if something got into the labyrinth&#x2014;&#x201d; Alice began.</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Soranna grabbed the collar of her shirt. &#x201c;<i>Not</i> through the labyrinth. They&#x2019;re coming through the<i>real</i> world. Take you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by surprise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes rolled up in her head, and she slumped back. Alice hastily checked her breathing and found it steady.</p><p>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t send monsters through the real world,&#x201d; Isaac said.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Alice said, looking down at Soranna.</p><p>&#x201c;The humans would see them,&#x201d; Isaac said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the oldest rule of the Readers, not to draw attention.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think the Readers have thrown away the rulebook,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Go find Magda, and then sound the alarm. We need to get everyone into the library.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Alice looked through the window to the back garden. Above the brooding bulk of the library and the dense mass of trees that surrounded it, the night sky was a field of stars streaked with irregular clouds. But underneath those clouds, moving fast, were two points of bright orange light.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Now,</i> Isaac!&#x201d; Alice shouted, and he ran.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER TWO: EVACUATION</b></p><p>Deep in the house, a gong began to sound. It might once have been used to call the residents of the house to dinner. Now it served to raise the alarm, rousing all the creatures who&#x2019;d taken shelter.</p><p>It was time. The plan was the same one Michael and Isaac had been practicing with the swamp sprites: Get everyone to the library. They&#x2019;d rehearsed it a couple of times, or tried to. The idea of training was foreign to the sprites and the Enoki, while Lool, the clockwork spider, had insisted on computing the best route instead of actually following the group.</p><p>Alice was miserably aware that even their best performance had taken fifteen or twenty minutes to get everyone out of danger. Given how fast the sunhawks were moving, they might not even have ten. She could hear clattering footsteps and muffled voices upstairs. Soranna still slumped on the bench, unconscious, and Alice wavered, wanting to direct the evacuation but not willing to leave her friend hurt and alone.</p><p>Fortunately, at that moment there was a hollow clatter in the doorway, and Magda the bone witch arrived. She was a large woman, covered head to toe in bones: She wore them around her neck, woven into the elaborate bun of her hair, and threaded onto wires as a long, trailing cloak. They clicked and rattled continuously as she moved. Since Alice had declared war on the old Readers, Magda had been one of her most dedicated supporters, and her impressive presence had done a great deal to keep the other creatures in line.</p><p>More importantly, for the moment, she was close enough to human to know something about medicine. Alice beckoned her over, and Magda&#x2019;s breath caught at the sight of Soranna.</p><p>&#x201c;By Ushbar!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Isaac said you needed help. She&#x2019;s had a hard time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; Alice said, gesturing to the window. &#x201c;I need to be out there. Please take her to the library and do what you can for her?&#x201d;</p><p>Magda nodded and clapped her hands together, like a teacher calling a class to attention. The bones on her cloak shivered, then rose up with a tremendous rattle, long strings of them stretching out like multi-jointed limbs. Hands unfolded at the ends, bony fingers opening to slip under Soranna with surprising gentleness.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got her,&#x201d; Magda said. &#x201c;Go! They need your help. Send old man Coryptus to me if you can.&#x201d;</p><p>Alice nodded and raced from the kitchen. In the main hall, creatures of all kinds were already heading to the back door, where Isaac was waiting to hurry them across the lawn toward the library. Several different varieties of sprites, elfin humanoids with eyes and hair in a rainbow of colors, were pushing and shoving at the base of the stairs, while a clutch of wide-eyed Enoki children were backed up behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough!&#x201d; Alice shouted, wading into the fray.</p><p>She wrapped herself in Spike&#x2019;s thread for strength, picking up the sprites and forcing them apart where she had to. Mostly they separated themselves at the sight of her. There was awe in their eyes, and they rushed to obey when she directed them to the exit.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said one of the Enoki women. Like all her kind, she looked mostly human, except for the mushrooms that grew up from her hair, back, and shoulders. The fungi came in as many varieties as human hair or skin color, and this one was a pretty red with white spots.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought they would never move,&#x201d; the woman went on. &#x201c;Do you know what&#x2019;s happening? Is it safe to go outside?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice sighed inwardly. The mushroom people were friendly, but timid to a fault, refusing to fight or even argue.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be safe once you get to the library,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>The younger women nodded and began herding their charges out. Another trio of sprites came down the stairs, swamp sprites whose muddy forms made a mess of the carpet, followed by the harpy girl Ephraster and her two young siblings. ...</p></p><h2>The Saturday Evening Girls Club: A Novel</h2><p><p><b> In Boston&#x2019;s North End, four immigrant women leave childhood behind&#x2014;but never one another. </b></p><p>For four young immigrant women living in Boston&#x2019;s North End in the early 1900s, escaping tradition doesn&#x2019;t come easy.

A New Understanding of Guilt and Forgiveness</h2><p>From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt and inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept ourselves and others even when we and they are less than perfect. How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God&#39;s love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.</p><p>90 minutes<br>Read by the Author<br><br>"If there were a quick fix for our trouble globe, it would be the profoundly tolerant message, teeming with humanity, at the heart of this book."<br>-Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul<br><br>From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt ad inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept out selves and others even when we are less than perfect.<br><br>Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality, and child-rearing as well as a sense of our mortality.<br><br>Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology, and his won thirty years of experienceHarold Kushner's pervious books include To Life!, Who Needs God, When Children Ask&nbsp;&nbsp;About God, When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough, and When Bad Things Happen to Good People.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in the Boston suburb of Natick, Massachusetts.</p><h2>What the Moon Saw</h2><p><b>An intimate, award winning story of immigrants and their families, the borders they cross, and the ties that bind us all together.</b><br><br>Fourteen-year-old Clara Luna's name means "clear moon" in Spanish. But lately, her life has felt anything but clear. A letter has arrived from her grandparents in Mexico inviting her to stay with them for the summer.&nbsp;But Clara has never met her father's parents. All she knows is that he snuck over the border from Mexico as a teenager. <br><br> When she arrives, she's stunned by how different her grandparents' life is from her own in the United States. They live in simple shacks in the mountains of southern Mexico, where most people speak not only Spanish, but an indigenous language, Mixteco.

The author lives in Colorado.1<br><br> Clara<br><br> Moonlight is what started everything, what led me to the edge one May night. Yes, I know I sound like a lunatic, but it&#x2019;s fitting since Luna is my last name. Clara Luna. Clara Lunatic is what some boys at school call me. I turn red and roll my eyes when they say it, but Mom says this is the way eighth-grade boys flirt. I wish they knew what my name means in Spanish: Clear Moon. I didn&#x2019;t feel like a clear moon on the day my adventure began, though. More like a fuzzy moon, just a faint light through clouds.<br><br> It was the afternoon of my neighborhood&#x2019;s spring fair, and I was supposed to meet my best friend, Samantha, at one o&#x2019;clock at the snowball stand, but she was late as usual. I was sweating and waiting in line for a raspberry snow cone when I noticed a miniature Walnut Hill set up on the table next to me. It was an exact replica of my neighborhood&#x2014;every single house was there! There were little plastic people everywhere&#x2014;smiling kids with helmets riding bikes on my street, women gardening, couples jogging, a teenager mowing the lawn, people barbecuing on their decks. It was kind of cool, but kind of creepy.<br><br> I found my family&#x2019;s house, and sure enough, the shutters were dark green, and the aluminum siding was tan, just like ours. For some reason I shivered, even though the sun was blazing and sweat was dripping down my neck. In the backyard of our house, under a tree, stood a girl who looked about my age, fourteen. Her skin was lighter than mine and her hair was only down to her shoulders, but still, looking at her gave me goose bumps. Of course, her hair was painted on, so I couldn&#x2019;t tell if she had the same streak of pumpkin orange underneath where I&#x2019;d tested blond highlights the month before. She did have the same chubby cheeks, and the same way of standing awkwardly, as though she didn&#x2019;t know what to do with her hands.<br><br> I paid for the snow cone and stayed staring at the tiny neighborhood, licking the syrupy ice.<br><br> &#x201c;Pretty neato, huh?&#x201d; said one of the mothers at the table behind a sign that read walnut hill neighborhood association. &#x201c;You see your own house there, hon?&#x201d;<br><br> I pretended not to hear her, and she turned away to talk with another mother about a shoe sale at the mall. Then I did something crazy. I didn&#x2019;t know why, but I reached over and tried to pick up the plastic girl. She was glued down, and didn&#x2019;t budge. I reached my other hand over and held down the turf grass as I yanked her up. She came up, but only after half my snow cone had fallen into my miniature yard.<br><br> The mother glanced back at me as slush dripped off the tree, making a red puddle where the girl used to be.<br><br> Her mouth dropped open, and before she could say anything, I turned and ran.<br><br> Samantha walked up to me at the bike racks just as I was fumbling with my bike lock. I could tell she&#x2019;d spent hours in the bathroom perfecting her makeup, which was probably what made her so late. She begged me to stay and hang out with her for a while. I did, but I made sure we stayed far away from the miniature neighborhood. The rest of the afternoon I didn&#x2019;t talk much. I felt like a hazy moon, all fogged up with questions that Samantha wouldn&#x2019;t understand. I&#x2019;m more than just a plastic doll, aren&#x2019;t I? Who am I, really? Who did I come from?<br><br> On Dad&#x2019;s side, I had no idea. All I knew was that before I was born, Dad crossed the Mexican border into Arizona, illegally&#x2014;probably the only time in his life he&#x2019;d broken a law. He hiked through the desert for three days and two nights, thirsty all the time, careful to stay hidden from the border police. In the cool darkness of night he walked, and during the blazing days he rested in the shade of cacti. Over the next years he picked tomatoes in the Southwest, and apples in the Northwest, and then made his way to the East Coast, where he mowed lawns and fell in love with his En-glish tutor&#x2014;my mother. He married her and started his own landscaping business. Then I was born and then my little brother, Hector, and we all moved to Walnut Hill, suburban Maryland.<br><br> For all my fourteen years I&#x2019;d never thought much about Mexico&#x2014;at least not until those questions began taking over my mind like tangled weeds.<br><br> The night after I freed the plastic girl, I couldn&#x2019;t sleep. The moonlight through my window made me restless. I picked up the girl from my nightstand and felt her hard and smooth in my hand. I couldn&#x2019;t stop fiddling with her, the way I could never help wiggling a loose tooth with my tongue.<br><br> After a long time, I slipped the doll into the pocket of my nightgown and crept downstairs, opened the sliding glass doors, and balanced there on the metal edge in my bare feet. The air felt damp and warm for a May night. The grass smelled especially strong, and the trees seemed to be watching me.<br><br> I took the first step onto the cold concrete of the pa- tio. There was the hum of the air-conditioning fan, and beyond that, songs of crickets and maybe frogs.<br><br> Another few steps. My feet touched the wet blades of grass. This shocked me, woke me up. I walked across a wide stretch of lawn, and the ground squished beneath me like a sponge. I didn&#x2019;t know where I was headed or why I was headed there.<br><br> Once I stepped past the edge of our yard, the grass didn&#x2019;t feel any different, but I did. On and on I went. Across the Morgans&#x2019; lawn, along the Taylors&#x2019; fence into the Sweeneys&#x2019; yard, around their plastic-lined pond and down their driveway. I cut across the cul-de-sac, through more yards and streets. No cars moving. No people. Purple-blue shadows draped everything. I realized I was making a beeline for the patch of forest that marked the end of Walnut Hill.<br><br> I crossed the border between the last trimmed lawn and the tangle of wild grasses. I walked farther and farther into the shadows, weaving in and out of tree trunks, letting my hands run along their rough bark.<br><br> I missed this feeling. Until the year before, Samantha and I used to play in these woods together after school. Sometimes we were priestesses who could talk with animals in the Otherworld. Sometimes gypsy dancers living in treetops in the Black Forest. Sometimes scientists collecting insects in the Amazon. I&#x2019;d always thought it was a magical place during the daytime, but in the moonlight it was more than magi-cal; it was a different world.</p><h2>Black Swan: The Twelve Lessons of Abandonment Recovery</h2><p><p><i>Black Swan: The Twelve Lessons of Abandonment Recovery</i> is a self help tool, a supplement for personal growth.

Ever since my first book I have been writing what I have affectionately called "The Book." I've wanted to bring together sound science with real food to offer people a realistic alternative to a long line of fad diets that have failed them.<br>&nbsp;<br>The problem has been the state of the scientific research into diet and nutrition. Only in the last decade or so have we really had a significant body of good, reliable research into the relationship between diet and diseases like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. That's what has allowed me to write&nbsp;<i>Just Tell Me What to Eat</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Without the benefit of sound science, in the last 40 years we've seen an explosion of well-meaning authors who created diets that focused on the wrong thing - not food but the macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and proteins. These diets have stolen food from us and changed the conversation in such a way that we no longer think of food as food. Now people think about food in terms of macronutrients, which are either "good" or "bad" with no grey areas. First carbs were demonized - essentially stolen from us for no good reason - and then fats were labeled "bad" based on incomplete science.<br>&nbsp;<br>That's been unfortunate because the recent boom of research into food and nutrition tells us that the right diet is not about any one macronutrient - it's about food and moderation. Those who eat real food and in the right balance do well. They lose weight and have fewer heart attacks, less diabetes and lower risk of cancer.<br>&nbsp;<br>In our day to day lives, eating is not about macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats, it's about food! We don't go to the store and look for carbs. When we're there we don't ask the butcher for protein. No one opens their fridge and says "hmmm, what fat will I have for dinner?"

Don t worry almost everyone is. Either we think the subject is too impolite, or we don t want to be branded an intolerant fanatic, or we re afraid we won t represent the pro-life side well enough. Whatever the reason for this fear, it causes many of us pass up opportunities to speak out on behalf of the unborn. You can overcome this fear, says Trent Horn in his new book Persuasive Pro-Life. With a little knowledge and a few proven techniques, you can become a bold and effective apologist for life. Drawing on over a decade as a pro-life organizer, Horn helps you cut through the diversions and obfuscations of the pro-choice side in order to accurately frame the legal, historical, and medical issue surrounding abortion. Then he demonstrates with vivid personal examples from his years of campus activism the importance of being charitable in all abortion debates, no matter how strident the other side might be. We must be not just warriors for the pro-life cause, he says, but ambassadors for it. Then Horn leads you a guided tour of the many types of pro-abortion opponent or inquirer ( the pragmatist, the skeptic, the conflicted ) along with more real-life examples. In each case he teaches you specific approaches what to say, what not to say, and how to bear yourself that are custom-tailored to every situation. The struggle over abortion has never been hotter, and the stakes could not be higher. Read Persuasive Pro-Life today and never again be afraid to speak up for the precious and fundamental right to life.</p><p>Trent Horn is an apologist at Catholic Answers. Since he converted to Catholicism at the age of 17, Trent has had a passion for explaining and defending the Faith. After college, Trent traveled the country training pro-life advocates on college campuses to engage opponents in compassionate and persuasive dialogue. Trent then earned a master s degree in theology at Franciscan University of Steubenville and before joining Catholic Answers served as a respect life coordinator for the Diocese of Phoenix. A dynamic speaker and debater, Trent is also the author of Answering Atheism and Persuasive Pro-Life.Trent Horn really knows how to get people thinking and talking about abortion. Persuasive Pro-Life is an invaluable handbook for anyone who wants to become more skilled at defending the humanity of the preborn. -- Lila Rose "President, Live Action"<br><br>I am so grateful for this book! It brilliantly combines reason and compassion in order to build up a culture of life. -- Fr. Frank Pavone "National Director, Priests for Life"<br><br>One of the strengths of this book is that it includes a great many practical tips that are incredibly important for pro-life advocates who want to be effective when talking to pro-choice people. -- Josh Brahm "President, Equal Rights Institute"<br><br>To change hearts and minds on abortion, it's not enough to be passionately pro-life. You also have to be intelligently pro-life. Trent shares over a decade of experience on the front lines and teaches us how to approach the discussion with confidence, charity, and effectiveness. -- Eric Scheidler "Executive director, Pro-life Action League"<br><br>Although the Catholic Church defends the sanctity of human life, many Catholics are ill-equipped to discuss the issue of abortion in a way that is persuasive to those who disagree with the Church's position or do not fully understand it. For this reason, Trent Horn's book should be required reading for every Catholic in the United States. -- Francis J. Beckwith "Professor of Philosophy and Church-State Studies, Baylor University"</p><h2>Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre</h2><p>On December 29, 1890, five hundred American troops massed around hundreds of unarmed Lakota Sioux men, women, and children near Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota. Outnumbered and demoralized, the Sioux posed no threat to the soldiers and put up no resistance. But in a chaotic scene, the Americans opened fire with howitzers, killing nearly three hundred Sioux in what would become known as the Wounded Knee Massacre. In this definitive account, acclaimed historian Heather Cox Richardson shows that the origins of this quintessential American tragedy lay not in the West but in Washington, where would-be lawmakers, locked in a desperate midterm-election battle, sought to drum up votes through an age-old political tool: fear.</p><p><b>Heather Cox Richardson</b> is a Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Etulain, author of <i>Beyond the Missouri: The Story of the American West</i></b><br> &#x201c;In this provocative history Heather Cox Richardson traces the close linkages among late-nineteenth century politics, the West, and the horrendous Wounded Knee incident of 1890-91.

Here she portrays one of the most infamous events of its time as a consequence of politics, both in its seediest maneuverings and its more ennobling impulses. The story is tragic, the scholarship exhilarating, and the book is a must read for anyone drawn to this troubling and fascinating time."<br><b>William Deverell, Director of the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West</b><br> &#x201c;Beyond grace and intelligence, what makes this book so important is that it demonstrates how one of the most tragic moments in all of American history is best understood not only as a spasm of genocidal violence but as something emerging from the everyday processes of politics and culture in the late nineteenth century. It is precisely that mixture of the banal and the horrific that makes this book compelling, significant, and deeply troubling.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br> &#x201c;[Richardson argues] that the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890) was the inevitable end result of Reconstruction politics, which featured bitter partisanship and a media establishment run amok....

Richards, author of <i>The California Gold Rush and the Coming of the Civil War</i></b><br> &#x201c;With a mastery that brings even her bit players to life, Heather Cox Richardson has given us a fresh and vivid account of the greed, partisan politics, prejudice, and butchery that led to the massacre at Wounded Knee.

Instead, she proves that the massacre emerged out of misguided federal Indian policies and, above all else, partisan politics. The story is chilling. You'll want to put it down, but because it's so well told here, you won't be able to.&#x201d;<br><br><b> Eric Rauchway, Professor of History at the University of California, Davis, and author of <i>Blessed Among Nations</i> and <i>Murdering McKinley</i></b><br> &#x201c;A gifted historian with a talent for narrative, Heather Cox Richardson uses her skills here to show that the killings at Wounded Knee might have happened at the edge of America, but they happened because of conflicts at the center of the nation's capital and the heart of the political struggles of the nineteenth century.

What draws you to the fantasy genre in the first place and what inspired you to switch from faeries to werewolves?</p> <p><strong>Stiefvater:</strong> Oh, I&#x2019;ve always been addicted to contemporary fantasy--fantasy set in the real world. I&#x2019;m thinking Diana Wynne Jones was possibly the one who first made me fall in love. But I remember all of these great middle grade books that were magic in the real world . . . <em>The Girl With the Silver Eyes</em>, <em>The Castle in the Attic</em>, <em>The Indian in the Cupboard</em>. All of the Narnia books. Mmmm. Now I&#x2019;m wanting to re-read! I still have most of my favorites. <br><br> I guess I just love that feeling of otherness. Of moreness. That you could turn the corner and bam, something strange would be there. I was never drawn so much to a complete fantasy world. The appeal was slipping something fantastic very cleverly into our world. So werewolves . . . I happened on them by accident, when I was looking for something bittersweet to write about, something about losing your identity. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll see werewolves from me again after this series. My next books are about other magical things altogether.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you enjoy most about writing for young adults (and for those of us adults who can&#x2019;t resist a good YA read)?</p> <p><strong> Stiefvater: </strong>I love writing for such a passionate audience. They&#x2019;re not afraid to feel completely, to believe in true love, to want to be incredible people who may possibly also be astronauts or rock stars. Young adults want something more and that, in a nutshell, is what I like to write about.</p> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>In <em>Shiver</em>, the narration alternates between Sam and Grace. In <em>Linger</em>, you add two more voices&#x2014;Isabel and Cole St. Clair. What were the challenges (and joys!) of doing so?</p> <p><strong><strong> Stiefvater:</strong> </strong>Oh, it was insane. The hard bit was keeping everyone&#x2019;s voices straight and consistent of course. They had to sound distinct while still sounding like they belonged in the same book. Each had a distinct vocabulary. Sam, for instance, says &#x201c;amongst.&#x201d; The others can&#x2019;t say amongst. Isabel has her own particular brand of swear words. Cole has his own way of describing the world. Grace sees action in a particular way. The challenge was picking which character narrated each scene; who saw what I needed the reader to see? They were all so different. Of course, that was the joy as well. Hard to get bored that way . . .</p> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>At the end of <em>Shiver</em>, Olivia changes&#x2014;a lot. What do you think she is doing right now?</p> <p><strong><strong> Stiefvater:</strong> </strong>Something spoilery that I&#x2019;m not going to tell you about.</p> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>We read your blog and know you love music. If you had to pick one song each to represent Sam, Grace, Isabel, Cole, and Beck&#x2013; which would you choose?</p> <p><strong><strong> Stiefvater:</strong> </strong>First of all, thanks for reading my blog! And yes, I&#x2019;m crazy about music. Okay. Songs for each character? <strong><br><br> </strong>Sam: &#x201c;A Message&#x201d; by Coldplay. The sound is great, more acoustic than Coldplay&#x2019;s usual stuff, and the lyrics are very appropriate for Sam. <strong><br><br> </strong>Grace: &#x201c;Winter Song&#x201d; by Ingrid Michaelson &amp; Sara Bareilles.

Sometimes these messes are literal, like a house that would be easier to condemn than to clean. But sometimes they are intangible messes such as illness, conflict, depression, abuse, bankruptcy, divorce, and job loss. And these messes can be painful, hurting our hearts and our homes. But as we see in the Bible, God loves to use messy people!</p> <p>In this six-week study, we will dig into the lives of biblical heroes who were messy people just like us but who were used by God in powerful ways. Together we will examine the stories of five wonderful but messy people and one messy parable character: Rahab, the Prodigal Son, Josiah, Mary, David, and Daniel. From their stories, we will learn how God can use broken people, restore damaged hearts and relationships, give us power to handle our critics, and help us deal with the hard moments of life. Along the way we&#x2019;ll discover that we don&#x2019;t have to just endure messy lives but can actually learn to thrive with God&#x2019;s guidance and help. In the hands of God, our messes can become His masterpieces!</p> <p>The Leader Guide, to be used along with the study's workbook and DVD, contains six session plan outlines, complete with discussion points and questions, activities, prayers, and more&#x2014;plus leader helps for facilitating a group.</p> <p>Other components for the Bible study, available separately, include a Participant Workbook, and DVD with six 10-15 minute sessions.</p></p><p><p>Jennifer Cowart is the executive pastor at Harvest Church, a United Methodist congregation in Warner Robins, Georgia, that she and her husband, Jim, began in 2001.

He knew that voice. It tugged at parts of him that had lain dormant for a long time--or never genuinely existed at all, depending on one's viewpoint.<br><br> He shied away from both memory and contemplation. There was no point wasting energy on either when his very survival was at stake. How many days he had been down the pit he no longer knew, but in that time he had neither eaten nor slept. His enemy wasn't physical in the sense of a foe he could strike down or manipulate. It was himself--his fallible body, his weak mind, his faltering spirit. He would endure and emerge whole, or never emerge at all.<br><br> Such was the life of Darth Vader's secret apprentice.<br><br> "He is dead."<br><br> "Then he is now more powerful than ever."<br><br> More voices. He closed his eyes and shook his head. Kneeling, he placed his manacled hands on the slick metal surface below him and concentrated on hearing the world outside.<br><br> Long stretches of isolation had attuned him to the cloning facility's many moods. Through the metal he heard a relentless hiss that could only be rain. Sharp cracking sounds were lightning, coming and going in staccato waves. Rolling rumbles were thunder, and a deeper note still was the song of seabed-hugging currents that circled the world.<br><br> He was on Kamino. Starkiller was sure of that much. He had been reborn on the distant waterworld, where a significant percentage of the Emperor's stormtroopers were grown. Here it was that he would live and grow strong, or die weak and unmourned. Every hardship, every hurdle, was one step closer to full mastery of his fate. That was the lesson underlying all lessons.<br><br> A new note entered the planet's endless song: the scream of a TIE advanced prototype starfighter. Angular and fleet, with bent vanes, it entered the atmosphere with a whip-crack sonic boom and descended on a bold, high-energy descent toward the facility.<br><br> Starkiller tensed. He knew that ship's sound and could sense the well-practiced hand behind its controls. He heard stormtroopers marching quickly in response to their master's electronic summons, calling orders to one another as they went. Blast doors opened and closed with booming thuds. The facility woke from its unattended slumber.<br><br> He didn't move as the TIE fighter landed. He didn't open his eyes as two heavy, booted feet dropped onto the platform and began the long walk through the facility. He breathed at a steady pace through the whine of the turbolift and the hiss of doors opening. A ring of red lights at the top of the pit came on, and although he felt the light against his hunched back, he didn't look up.<br><br> He heard breathing, mechanical and regular. Heavy footsteps came to the very lip of the pit, and stopped.<br><br> "You're alive," said Darth Vader.<br><br> At the voice of his former Master, Starkiller looked up, blinking against the light. Vader's boots were three meters above him, barely visible behind the lights and the grate that separated the pit from the dark room beyond. The Dark Lord loomed like a shadow, a black hole in the shape of a robed man.<br><br> Starkiller's throat worked. It was so dry he could barely talk at all.<br><br> "How long this time?"<br><br> "Thirteen days. Impressive."<br><br> The compliment was hard-won. It ground out of the triangular grille covering Vader's mouth and fell on Starkiller's ears like dust.<br><br> "The Force gives me all I need."<br><br> "The Force?"<br><br> The hint of praise turned to warning, as it did so often.<br><br> Starkiller lowered his head. He knew what was required. The weeks of training and isolation he had endured made that exceedingly clear.<br><br> "The dark side, I mean, my Master."<br><br> One gloved hand moved. The grate flew open.<br><br> "Come," said the dark figure above him.<br><br> The metal floor beneath Starkiller lurched and began to ascend. He forced his leg muscles to unlock from their long kneeling position, and stood to meet Darth Vader upright and unbowed.<br><br> The room above was sparsely furnished, with no windows, just one exit--the turbolift--and little light. Shadows cast by terminals and floor lamps made its very dimensions ambiguous, but Starkiller knew from long training exercises that the room was circular and its walls were impenetrable. He flexed his fingers, yearning for a lightsaber to hold. Muscle memory was keener than any other kind. Even with the new skills Darth Vader had taught him, his hands wanted to fight the way he knew best.<br><br> At the very edge of his vision stood several skeletal PROXY droids, awaiting activation. If he was lucky, he would be unshackled and allowed to duel some of them. If not . . .<br><br> The lift ground to a halt. Vader stepped back to study him. Starkiller felt the keen eye of the Sith Lord on his gaunt form even through the layers of durasteel, obsidian, and plasteel that covered the man's face. Something was different. Although nothing had been said, he could tell that this was no ordinary training session.<br><br> He waited. There was no hurrying Darth Vader.<br><br> "I have a mission for you."<br><br> "Yes, my Master."<br><br> "Starkiller's former conspirator has been captured."<br><br> He experienced a moment of confusion. Then his memories stirred, providing a name. The name of the one who had lured him away from the dark side and to his death.<br><br> The same voice that had disturbed him from his meditation . . .<br><br> "Vader thinks he's turned you. But I can sense your future, and Vader isn't part of it. I sense only . . . me?"<br><br> "General Kota," he said, struggling to keep himself anchored to the present.<br><br> "Yes. You will travel to Cato Neimoidia and execute him."<br><br> "And then will my training be complete, Master?"<br><br> "You will not be ready to face the Emperor until you have faced a true Jedi Master."<br><br> The voice was Darth Vader's, but again from another time, another memory. The present-day Darth Vader hadn't spoken at all.<br><br> Starkiller put his manacled hands to his head and turned away, lest his disconcertion be exposed. No matter how he tried, no matter how he concentrated, the past simply wouldn't leave him alone.<br><br> Vader's close attention hadn't ebbed. "You are still haunted by visions."<br><br> "Yes." There was no point denying it. "Yes, my Master."<br><br> "Tell me what you see."<br><br> He didn't know where to start. Thirteen days, this time, he had stayed motionless in the pit, subjected to visions and hallucinations through all his senses: strange odors, fleeting touches, voices calling him, sights he could never have imagined. He tried to ignore them, and when he couldn't ignore them, he tried to piece them together instead. Neither was entirely possible, and every attempt hurt so badly he despaired of it ever ending.<br><br> "Sometimes," he said, falteringly, "I smell a forest on fire."<br><br> "Continue."<br><br> "I see the general falling, and feel the ground shake as a starship crashes around me. And I hear a woman--a woman's voice--when I try to sleep." He swallowed. This was the most painful recollection of all. "I can't understand what she's saying. Do you know who she is?"<br><br> A pleading note had entered his voice, and he hated himself for it.<br><br> "They are the memories of a dead man." Vader came closer, his physical presence lending weight to his words. "A side effect of the accelerated cloning process and the memory flashes used to train you. They will fade."<br><br> "What if they don't?"<br><br> "Then you will be of no use to me."<br><br> Starkiller straightened. For the first time, that fact had been said aloud. He had always known it was so; Darth Vader wasn't renowned for his charity. But to hear it stated so baldly--that this Starkiller, this clone, would be disposed of like some faulty droid if he didn't pull himself together soon--had a profoundly focusing effect.<br><br> Not for long.<br><br> "Try the Corellian razor hounds."<br><br> That was a new voice, one he hadn't heard before. He winced, and knew that by wincing he had effectively doomed himself.<br><br> "Starkiller's emotions made him weak," the Dark Lord said. "If you are to serve me, you must be strong."<br><br> What form of service that might take, Darth Vader had never said. To take the former Starkiller's place, he presumed, as a weapon that could be aimed at the Emperor then Vader's enemies whenever he commanded. From treacherous commanders to perhaps the Emperor himself--that was how it had been, and how he assumed it would be now. For the moment, however, that didn't matter. The new Starkiller wanted only to live.<br><br> "I am strong, my Master, and I am getting stronger."<br><br> Vader stepped behind him and waved a hand. Metal complained as the manacles dropped from Starkiller's wrists and hit the floor with a boom.<br><br> "Show me."<br><br> Numerous pairs of eyes lit up in the shadows. The PROXY droids were activating. Starkiller's fists balled in readiness. He had defeated their training programs over and over again. There wasn't a Jedi simulation that could beat him.<br><br> But this was different. Even as Darth Vader provided him with his weapons--two lightsabers with matched crystals, producing identical red blades--he saw that he wouldn't be fighting Jedi Knights this time. The targets stepping out of the shadows wore uniforms not dissimilar in color to the Sith's ancient enemy, but these were ordinary men armed with nothing more than blasters.<br><br> He had seen such armor before, in the memories of the original Starkiller's life. Men like this had fought him in a TIE fighter factory high above Nar Shaddaa. They had been on Corellia, too. He remembered the places clearly, even if he couldn't put them in context. The uniforms weren't Imperial.&nbsp;</p><h2>Linguistics For Dummies</h2><p><b>The fascinating, fun, and friendly way to understand the science behind human language</b> <p>Linguistics is the scientific study of human language.

Child life is a profession that draws on the insights of history, sociology, anthropology and psychology to serve children and families in many critical stress points in their lives, but especially when they are ill, injured or disabled and encounter the hosts of caregivers and institutions that collaborate to make them well. Children and their families can become overwhelmed by the task of understanding and navigating the healthcare environment and continue to face challenges through their daily encounters. It is the job of child life professionals to provide care and guidance in these negotiations to serve as culture brokers, interpreters of the healthcare apparatus to family and child and the child to medical professionals. Despite the best efforts to provide quality, sensitive psychosocial care to children and their families, they remain vulnerable to lingering aftereffects. The goal of this revised edition is to help prepare child life specialists to deliver the highest level of care to children and families in the context of these changing realities. Each chapter has been substantially revised and two new chapters have been added. This book will be a valuable resource for not only child life specialists but also nurses, occupational and recreational therapists, social workers and other hospital personnel.</p><p>The author of the CLC Bulletin book review for the original version of The Handbook of Child Life offered praise that the book contains a vast amount of knowledge and topics spanning the profession and has an array of authors with a variety of education, background, experience, and voices (Ayoub, 2012.) This praise is still relevant for the 2018 edition. One of the previous critiques, however, as well as a stated goal of the updated version, was to increase the amount of current research cited within the book. Indeed, throughout the book, there is an obvious increase in both the number of sources as well as the addition of more recent literature, including some articles from 2016 and 2017. Stylistically, this newer volume contains more academic, updated language and eliminates outdated information in several areas. This is apparent from the beginning, as the first several paragraphs of the first chapter provide a more formalized, detailed account of how childhood has been viewed over the centuries. Importantly, this new edition contains updated information for child life professionals, particularly on the topics of research and technology use. Thompson, Bennett, and Snow (2018) highlight the importance of research and evidence-based practice and mention the Association of Child Life Professionals&#39; efforts to increase access to research results on clinical practice through publications and newsletters. Thompson et al. note a &#34;formal, professional need to locate and apply research findings in conjunction with the heightened awareness and inclusion of evidence-based practice&#34; (Thompson et al., 2018, p. 56), and provide examples of increased child life involvement in research efforts since 2009. The book also examines how technology and data methods have been used to create new tools useful for clinical practice as well as research, such as the Psychosocial Risk Assessment in Pediatrics (PRAP). The use of iPads and video games as teaching and recreational modalities is explored as well. Several entirely new chapters are included, focusing on increasingly relevant topics for child life such as the development of one-person programs and community-based practice. Chapter 11 &#34;One-Person Child-Life Programs&#34; reads almost as a &#34;how-to&#34; guide with excellent advice for anyone seeking to start and sustain a one-person program.

Each story is accompanied by scripture, prayer, and discussion exercises designed to remind readers of Mary of Medjugorje's intercession on their behalf and God's personal love for them.<br><br>Ideal for personal reading or use in parish faith-sharing groups, addiction recovery support groups, and for parish retreats.</p><p>Christine Watkins holds a master&#39;s degree in theological studies from the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley and a master&#39;s degree in social welfare from the University of California at Berkeley&#39;s School of Social Welfare. She is trained in Ignatian spirituality and discernment, with ten years of work experience as a spiritual director, bereavement counselor, inspirational speaker, and retreat leader. Watkins lives in California with her husband and sons."Christine Watkins's beautiful and touching collection of conversion stories prompted by Medjugorje's apparitions is further proof of the good fruits of this ongoing phenomenon. The stories are direct, honest, heart-rending, and miraculous." --<b>Wayne Weible</b>, Author of <i>Medjugorje: The Message</i><br><br>"How much do those caught in the coils of life's deceptive attractions long to think there is a way out? I praise God that the subjects of these conversion stories care enough about us to bare their souls so that others might have hope. Who could resist the arms outstretched of Jesus and Mary as depicted by these desperate souls? Read this book. Rejoice. Give it to everyone you know who is looking for happiness in the wrong places and is desperate for salvation." --<b>Ronda Chervin</b>, Author of <i>Help in Time of Need</i><br><br>"I cannot think of another work on Medjugorje so well done! <i>Full of Grace</i> certainly caught my attention! While many other works on Medjugorje focus on the facts, figures, historical dates, and messages of the apparitions, they seem far less significant than the personal stories of miraculous conversion that have been captured in this remarkable book. <i>Full of Grace</i> is a magnificent blend of real life dramas that reveal the depth of Mary's power to intercede for us. This book will inspire you to call upon her." --<b>Theresa Burke</b>, Founder, Rachel's Vineyard Ministries<br><br>"Christine Watkins presents us with deeply inspirational testimonies of six individuals who tangibly experienced Mary's motherly protection and care and her call to give their hearts and minds to her Son through lives of service and intercession. These uplifting accounts and the reflections, scripture passages, and thought-provoking questions that follow are sure to help one grow in faith. This book was a blessing to me. May it be a powerful instrument in God's hands to draw lives to his grace." --<b>Anthony Rosevear, O.P.</b>, Novice Master, Western Dominican Province</p><h2>Trigger Mortis: A James Bond Novel</h2><p><p><em>James Bond</em> won his battle with criminal mastermind Auric Goldfinger, but a whole new war is about to begin.

How did you come to be involved with LEGO? </strong></p> <p>A. I study the management of innovation and was writing a book on my framework for innovation governance. It was going to be a typical business book, where each chapter was a piece of the framework illustrated with a case study or two from a different company. I had done cases on CarMax, McDonald&#x2019;s, Best Buy, Mattson, ING DIRECT, and a few other very good companies. But then I visited LEGO and saw not only a company with the most sophisticated innovation management system I&#x2019;d ever seen, but also a company that had been through an amazing roller coaster ride over the past decade, from near ruin to tremendous success, all because of the way they managed innovation.</p> <p><strong>Q. At what point did you realize you had uncovered a big story?</strong></p> <p>A. It was 2008 when I realized that I was onto something. Two things happened at the same time. First, when I taught the case study about the LEGO turnaround in IMD in 2008, I was surprised by the enthusiasm for the brand and the simple joy that the memories evoked. Talking about LEGO for a few hours put the executives I taught into a wonderful mood and at the same time taught them some valuable lessons about innovation management. It was also 2008 when the effects of the company&#x2019;s changes started to show up in their financial returns. From 2004 to 2007, their financial performance was good, but they were still working out problems in the supply chain and production system. After 2007, their performance began to skyrocket, as they introduced hit toy after hit toy. Those two things together convinced me there was a book to be written about what I was seeing.</p> <p><strong>Q. What does LEGO&#x2019;s journey teach business leaders about innovation &#x2013; perhaps even better than other company examples like Apple and Google?</strong></p> <p>A. What I like about LEGO is how &#x201c;inside the box&#x201d; they are. Too much of the literature on innovation is about the big, industry-changing innovations or about charismatic leaders who drive their companies to new heights. One of LEGO&#x2019;s managers, Per Hjuler, said to me: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m continually humbled by the power of the little idea.&#x201d; LEGO is successful because they are continually innovating on many different dimensions, but they&#x2019;re doing it within a fairly traditional business system.</p> <p><strong>Q. You call Bionicle the toy that saved LEGO, both in terms of financial impact and the lessons the company learned from it about innovation. Can you explain?</strong></p> <p>A. Bionicle was the toy that saved LEGO, even though it&#x2019;s always been a controversial toy within the company. There are those in LEGO who still believe it&#x2019;s not an appropriate toy to carry the LEGO brand. But without the revenues from Bionicle to carry them through the crisis years of 2003 and 2004, the company would not have survived.</p> <p>But Bionicle also taught LEGO some lessons about how to work with external partners, how to interact with passionate customers, and how to manage an intellectual property. LEGO had seen from its partnership with Star Wars how a rich story can captivate kids and drive sales of toys. But making toys around someone else&#x2019;s story is a different challenge than creating your own story and characters, and building toys around it. Bionicle boys loved the toy, and loved the T-shirts, books, comics, backpacks, sneakers, and everything else that had a Bionicle image on it. LEGO had to learn how to not only develop a toy with a rich story, but also work with a group of outside partners and bring them along as the story progressed. And by interacting with the fans online, Greg Farshtey, the guy in LEGO responsible for story and character development, could understand where the story was confusing or unclear and fix the issue in the next release.</p> <p><strong>Q. Another toy that taught LEGO a major lesson was Mindstorms, the programmable robots. What did LEGO learn from this?</strong></p> <p>A. LEGO took a unique approach when they developed the next generation of Mindstorms NXT &#x2013; the robotics kit they released in 2006. They opened up their innovation process, but they used the &#x201c;wisdom of the clique&#x201d; not the &#x201c;wisdom of the crowd&#x201d;. They started with a small group of sophisticated fans and brought them into the development process. As development progressed, they expanded the group steadily. When they had most of the major development decisions completed they opened up the process more, and used a crowd of one hundred fans to help them do the final development and testing. There&#x2019;s a lot written about the wisdom of the crowd and how powerful it can be, and I completely agree that if used well it can be a very powerful source of ideas. But early in the development process, when there are lots of constraints and tradeoffs, it helps to keep the team small and decision-making structures clear. LEGO learned some valuable lessons from Mindstorms about how to do that well.</p> <p><strong>Q. In just ten years, LEGO has gone from the brink of bankruptcy to the most valuable toy company in the world. What, in your opinion, was the most dramatic shift from the old LEGO to new?</strong></p> <p>A. The Company&#x2019;s brush with bankruptcy gave it a dose of humility that it sorely needed. In the years between 1999 and 2002, the company&#x2019;s manager made decisions about which toys to launch and which to kill. They proved remarkably bad at that. Mads Nipper, who runs all of product development and marketing, says &#x201c;there are only two totally honest groups of people in the world: kids and drunks.&#x201d; Now, when LEGO is looking to develop a toy, they show different concepts to groups of kids, then they do rough mockups of the toys, then more finished versions, and so on until they&#x2019;re sure they&#x2019;ve got the toy right. Management&#x2019;s role has changed from making decisions about which toys to bring to market, to making sure their teams have tested the toys thoroughly.</p><b>DAVID C.

May&#x2014;now with charming new illustrations!<br><br>Every year at Christmastime, everyone&#x2014;young and old alike&#x2014;has one catchy, joy-inspiring song stuck in their heads: &#x201c;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!&#x201d; Now fans of the most famous reindeer of all-time can fall in love with the original story, written by Robert L. May in 1939.<br> <br>Rudolph, a youthful reindeer buck who possesses an unusual luminous red nose, is harassed mercilessly and excluded by his peers because of this trait. One particularly stormy Christmas Eve, Rudolph manages to prove himself after Santa Claus catches sight of his nose and asks him to lead his sleigh for the evening. Rudolph agrees, saving Christmas, and is finally treated the way he deserves by his fellow reindeer!</p><p>Robert L. May created Rudolph in 1939, when his company, the Montgomery Ward department stores, asked him to write a Christmas story that they could give away to customers. Drawing on the tale of &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling,&#x201d; Mr. May penned the story of a sweet, homely reindeer shunned because of his glowing red nose. Little did he know his creation was destined to become a Christmas holiday classic. Over the next few years, the company distributed millions of copies of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</i>. The book&#x2019;s copyright was transferred to Mr. May in 1947, and under his ownership, Rudolph&#x2019;s popularity soared. Commercial printings and cartoons quickly followed, and then, of course, came the song, which secured Rudolph&#x2019;s place in Christmas history, and in our hearts, forever. Robert L. May died in 1976.<br><br>Antonio Javier Caparo is a Cuban-born illustrator and designer. Although much of his early career was spent in graphic design, his passion for animation and comics led him to devote himself to illustration&#x2014;both traditional and digital. He has been published around the world and has won numerous awards in multiple countries. He lives in Quebec, Canada.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Written in 1939 for Montgomery Ward department stores, this is the original story that created an icon and inspired the classic song. Told in the style of Clement Clarke Moore's "A Visit from St. Nicholas," Rudolph of the glowing red nose is teased by the other deer, only taking comfort in the coming of Santa. "He'd get just as much (and this is what pleased him) as the happier, handsomer reindeer who teased him." On Christmas Eve, with a foggy night causing mishaps and endangering his mission, Santa turns to Rudolph to save the day. While not indicated, this version of May's story has been adapted somewhat, with several couplets removed and some changes to words and phrases. This modernizes and streamlines the text, but also affects the richness of the language. The large trim size and many spreads make this a fun and easy choice for families and Rudolph fans to share.&#x2014;Brooke Sheets, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>I Will Be Okay (Mindful Mantras)</h2><p><b>To little children the world is&nbsp;B-I-G</b>&nbsp;and full of confusing situations that create hard to handle feelings.<br><br>Telling children repeatedly that they will be okay&nbsp;<b>doesn't&nbsp;work</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>Share the funny pictures in 'I Will Be Okay' with your children while reinforcing the idea that they are not helpless, and that they can do things for themselves when they have tricky feelings, that will help them feel okay again.&nbsp;<br><i><br><b>Worried about mom and dad going out for the night?</b>&nbsp;</i><br>Make them a surprise present to find when they return!<br><br><i><b>Scared of a thunderstorm?</b></i>&nbsp;<br>Hide in a fort with a friend.&nbsp;<br><br>Learn the Mindful Mantra '<b>I will be okay</b>' along with your children and practice it until it is an automatic thought.

The book provides an easy to understand introduction to Skinner s analysis of language (i.e., mands, tacts, &amp; intraverbals) with easy to follow examples of everyday language skills demonstrated by children. The book contains a brief language assessment system; the Behavioral Language Assessment Form (BLAF) that will give parents and teachers a quick overview of a child s language skills (see the <i>VB-MAPP</i> for a more thorough assessment). The assessment is followed by descriptions on the basic teaching procedures for developing early and intermediate mands, tacts, echoics, imitation, matching-to-sample, receptive language, and intraverbal skills. The use of sign language and other forms of augmentative communication are presented along with suggestions for IEP goals, skill tracking, and data collection. The book also contains a chapter on the need for both structured discrete trial training (DTT) and natural environment training (NET). This is the latest version of the book and has been re-edited (2010), and professionally typeset thus it is 70 pages less than the original version released in 1998.

This revolutionary paper challenged certain basic assumptions underlying much research in mathematics and logic. G�del received public recognition of his work in 1951 when he was awarded the first Albert Einstein Award for achievement in the natural sciences&#x2014;perhaps the highest award of its kind in the United States. The award committee described his work in mathematical logic as "one of the greatest contributions to the sciences in recent times."<br>However, few mathematicians of the time were equipped to understand the young scholar's complex proof. Ernest Nagel and James Newman provide a readable and accessible explanation to both scholars and non-specialists of the main ideas and broad implications of G�del's discovery. It offers every educated person with a taste for logic and philosophy the chance to understand a previously difficult and inaccessible subject.<br>Marking the 50th anniversary of the original publication of <b>G�del's Proof</b>, New York University Press is proud to publish this special anniversary edition of one of its bestselling and most frequently translated books. With a new introduction by Douglas R. Hofstadter, this book will appeal students, scholars, and professionals in the fields of mathematics, computer science, logic and philosophy, and science.</p></p><p>G�del's incompleteness theorem--which showed that any robust mathematical system contains statements that are true yet unprovable within the system--is an anomaly in 20th-century mathematics. Its conclusions are as strange as they are profound, but, unlike other recent theorems of comparable importance, grasping the main steps of the proof requires little more than high school algebra and a bit of patience. Ernest Nagel and James Newman's original text was one of the first (and best) to bring G�del's ideas to a mass audience. With brevity and clarity, the volume described the historical context that made G�del's theorem so paradigm-shattering. Where the first edition fell down, however, was in the guts of the proof itself; the brevity that served so well in defining the problem made their rendering of G�del's solution so dense as to be nearly indigestible.<p> This reissuance of Nagel and Newman's classic has been vastly improved by the deft editing of Douglas Hofstadter, a prot�g� of Nagel's and himself a popularizer of G�del's work. In the second edition, Hofstadter reworks significant sections of the book, clarifying and correcting here, adding necessary detail there. In the few instances in which his writing diverges from the spirit of the original, it is to emphasize the interplay between formal mathematical deduction and meta-mathematical reasoning--a subject explored in greater depth in Hofstadter's other delightful writings. <i>--Clark Williams-Derry</i></p><b>Ernest Nagel</b> was John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.<br><br><b>James R.

For Ben Benjamin, all has been lost--his wife, his family, his home, his livelihood. Hoping to find a new direction, he enrolls in a night class called The Fundamentals of Caregiving, where he will learn to take care of people with disabilities. He is instructed about professionalism, about how to keep an emotional distance between client and provider, and about the art of inserting catheters while avoiding liability. But when Ben is assigned his first client--a tyrannical nineteen-year-old boy named Trevor, who is in the advanced stages of Duchenne muscular dystrophy--he soon discovers that the endless service checklists have done nothing to prepare him for the reality of caring for a fiercely stubborn, sexually frustrated teenager who has an ax to grind with the whole world. Over time, the relationship between Ben and Trev, which had begun with mutual misgivings, evolves into a close friendship, and the traditional boundaries between patient and caregiver begin to blur. The bond between them strengthens as they embark on a road trip to visit Trev&#x2019;s ailing father--a journey rerouted by a series of bizarre roadside attractions that propel them into an impulsive adventure disrupted by one birth, two arrests, a freakish dust storm, and a six-hundred-mile cat-and-mouse pursuit by a mysterious brown Buick Skylark. By the end of that journey, Trev has had his first taste of love, and Ben has found a new reason to love life. Bursting with energy and filled with moments of absolute beauty, this big-hearted and inspired novel ponders life&#x2019;s terrible surprises as well as what it takes to truly care for another human being.</p><p><p><b> Amazon Exclusive: Essay by Jonathan Evison</b></p> <p>"Listen to me: everything you think you know, every relationship you&#x2019;ve ever taken for granted, every plan or possibility you&#x2019;ve ever hatched, every conceit or endeavor you&#x2019;ve ever concocted, can be stripped from you in an instant. Sooner or later, it will happen. So prepare yourself. Be ready not to be ready. Be ready to be brought to your knees and beaten to dust. Because no stable foundation, no act of will, no force of cautious habit will save you from this fact: nothing is indestructible."</p> <p>&#x2014; from <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em></p> <p>The weekend of my sister&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, she took a road trip with some friends down to Lucerne Valley in the Mojave Desert. For two weeks prior, the trip was a source of debate around our dinner table. My old man reasoned that since she was a responsible kid, got good grades, fed her pets, and honored her curfew, she ought to be allowed to take the trip. My mother reasoned that it was a bad idea. She didn&#x2019;t trust the other kids. They were a scraggly bunch.</p> <p>My sister took the trip. She never came home. She was killed in a freak car accident the weekend she turned sixteen years old. The incident, the specifics of which have never been explained satisfactorily by anyone, all but exploded my family. My parents divorced after twenty-five years of marriage. I lost what amounted to my primary caregiver. My oldest brother was deeply depressed for two years afterward and was really never the same in some fundamental way. To this day, my family is still feeling the shockwaves. I&#x2019;m still walking around with this sister-shaped hole in my heart. After a few beers, my brother will still lament the fact that he owed her seven bucks at the time of the accident. The seven bucks had been a point of contention involving the sale of a ten-speed bike. They argued fiercely about the money up until the day she left. At fifty-seven, my brother is still trying to pay that debt.</p> <p>There are holes in our lives that can never be filled--not really, not ever. And yet, we have no choice but to try to fill them. We must drive on in the face of debilitating loss, crippling guilt, overwhelming hopelessness. Because to give up is to be dead. I&#x2019;ve lived with this idea since I was five years old.</p> <p>Ben Benjamin is a character who has lost virtually everything--his wife, his family, his home, his livelihood. Broken, stripped down, stricken, and without hope, Ben is a shadow of his old self. He has been a stay-at-home dad for nearly a decade, so the job market has all but passed him by. With few options, Ben registers for a twenty-eight-hour night class called The Fundamentals of Caregiving, where, in the sweltering basement of the Abundant Life Foursquare Church, Ben learns how to insert catheters and avoid liability. He learns about professionalism and how to erect and maintain certain boundaries, how to keep physical and emotional distance between the client and the care provider. He learns that caregiving is just a job. But when Ben finds himself assigned to a tyrannical nineteen-year-old named Trev, who is in the advanced stages of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he discovers that the endless mnemonics and service plan checklists presented in his class have done little to prepare him for the reality of caring for a fiercely stubborn, scared, sexually frustrated adolescent with an ax to grind with the world at large.</p> <p>When I set out to write this novel, I didn&#x2019;t envision it as a road novel. I&#x2019;ve never had a desire to write a road novel--in fact, I was very resistant to the idea. But the characters led me to the road. They left me no choice. They all but dragged me kicking and screaming to the road. It seemed Ben and Trev were always driving around in that van of Trev&#x2019;s, but they were never getting anywhere. They were both stuck. They needed that van to deliver them somewhere--and I guess I needed it, too. Because that&#x2019;s where this novel delivered me. <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em> is a story of total collapse, and ultimately, reconstruction. Before it is over, this calamitous journey will cover five states, resulting in one birth, two arrests, and one instance of cannibalism and including a dust storm, a hail storm, several shit storms, and a six-hundred-mile cat-and-mouse pursuit by a mysterious Buick Skylark.</p> <p>Baggage is collected.</p> <p>Hearts are won and lost.</p> <p>Mistakes are forgiven.</p> <p>Futures are realized.</p> <p>This book represents nothing less than an emotional catharsis for its author. I wrote this book because I needed to. Because my sister went on a road trip thirty-nine years ago and never came back. And my family has yet to heal from this terrible fact. This novel is about the imperative of getting in that van, because you have no choice but to push yourself and drive on, and keep driving in the face of life&#x2019;s terrible surprises. It&#x2019;s about the people and the things you gather along that rough road back to humanity. And in the end, for me, <em>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</em> is the van in which I finally bring my sister home.</p>Jonathan Evison&nbsp;is&nbsp;the author of four previous novels, including&nbsp;<i>All About Lulu</i>,&nbsp;<i>West of Here</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Revised&nbsp;Fundamentals of Caregiving</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance!</i>&nbsp;He lives with his wife and family in&nbsp;Washington State.</p><h2>Unbreakable: What the Son of God Said About the Word of God</h2><p>The book you are looking at is unique. <p></p> <p>It stands out because unlike most other books on the Bible, it doesn t start with a bunch of objections that people have to the scriptures. Nor does it begin with information about the Bible s authors or the historical contexts they were writing into. Instead, this book uses Jesus as the starting point! As Andrew explains, Ultimately... our trust in the Bible stems from our trust in Jesus Christ... If you are a follower of Jesus, then you ll be keen to believe what the Bible says because, as you ll see in this book, that s what Jesus did! </p> <p>Andrew, in his clear and often amusing way, shows us clearly that the Son of God loved and trusted the Word of God and if anyone sets out that the Bible is trustworthy, authoritative, good, helpful and powerful... then it s Jesus Himself!</p></p><p>Andrew is an elder at Kings Church in Eastbourne.

In <i>Bad Religion </i>he offers a masterful and forceful account of how American Christianity has lost its way&#x2014;and why it threatens to take American society with it. <br><br>In a world populated by &#x201c;pray and grow rich&#x201d; gospels and Christian cults of self-esteem, Ross Douthat argues that America&#x2019;s problem isn&#x2019;t too much religion; nor is it intolerant secularism. Rather, it&#x2019;s <i>bad religion</i>. Conservative and liberal, political and pop cultural, traditionally religious and fashionably &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d;&#x2014;Christianity&#x2019;s place in American life has increasingly been taken over, not by atheism, but by heresy: debased versions of Christian faith that stroke our egos, indulge our follies, and encourage our worst impulses. <br><br>In a brilliant and provocative story that moves from the 1950s to the age of Obama, Douthat explores how bad religion has crippled the country&#x2019;s ability to confront our most pressing challenges and accelerated American decline.</p><p>Ross Douthat is a columnist for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;op-ed page. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>To Change the Church</i>,&nbsp;<i>Privilege</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Grand New Party</i>. Before joining <i>The&nbsp;</i><i>New York Times</i>,&nbsp;he was a senior editor for&nbsp;<i>The Atlantic</i>. He is the film critic for&nbsp;<i>National Review</i>, and he has appeared regularly on television, including&nbsp;<i>Charlie Rose</i>, PBS&nbsp;<i>NewsHour</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Real Time&nbsp;</i><i>with Bill Maher</i>.<b>ONE</b><br> <br><b>THE LOST WORLD</b><br> <br>Somewhere in the dark years between Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s invasion of Poland and the turn of the Second World War&#x2019;s tide, Wystan Hugh Auden returned to his childhood faith. The poet was living in New York, having emigrated from England shortly before the outbreak of the war, and he began attending services at St. Mark&#x2019;s in the Bouwerie, an Episcopal parish and New York&#x2019;s second oldest church. He officially entered Anglican Communion in October 1940, but he would later describe that precise date as less important than the general drift in his thinking about matters of religion, which had been pressing him back toward Christianity for some time.<br> <br>Some of the reasons for Auden&#x2019;s conversion were personal&#x2014;in particular, the experience of being betrayed by his lover Chester Kallman, which Auden later wrote forced him to &#x201c;know in person what it is like to feel oneself the prey of demonic powers, in both the Greek and Christian sense.&#x201d; But he had other motives, intellectual and cultural, that were very particular to that specific historical time and place. These motives included the influence of his literary contemporaries. Along with S�ren Kierkegaard, Auden would cite two of his fellow English writers, Charles Williams and C. S. Lewis&#x2014;both members of a famous literary circle that also included J. R. R. Tolkien&#x2014;as crucial to his return to religious belief, and once in America, he became fast friends with the Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his wife, Ursula, as well.<br> <br>Still more crucial, though, was the political context in which the poet found himself, and his reaction to the totalizing ideologies, Marxist and fascist, that were vying for mastery of Europe. In a 1957 essay on his re-conversion, Auden described a sojourn in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, at a time when the Republican struggle against Francisco Franco&#x2019;s fascists was a cause c�l�bre for the West&#x2019;s liberal intelligentsia. Following the example set by left-wing regimes from Mexico to Moscow, the Republicans had launched a campaign of persecution against the Spanish Catholic Church, and Auden arrived to find that all of the city&#x2019;s many churches had been closed and its priests exiled or killed. &#x201c;To my astonishment,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;this discovery left me profoundly shocked and disturbed.... I could not help acknowledging that, however I had consciously ignored and rejected the Church for sixteen years, the existence of churches and what went on in them had all the time been very important to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>What he felt during his Spanish encounter with left-wing anti-Christianity was similar to his reactions to the anti-Christianity of the right. The &#x201c;novelty and shock of the Nazis,&#x201d; Auden wrote, and the blitheness with which Hitler&#x2019;s acolytes dismissed Christianity &#x201c;on the grounds that to love one&#x2019;s neighbor as oneself was a command fit only for effeminate weaklings,&#x201d; pushed him inexorably toward unavoidable questions. &#x201c;If, as I am convinced, the Nazis are wrong and we are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs?&#x201d; The answer to this question, he wrote later, was part of what &#x201c;brought me back to the church.&#x201d; When confronting the phenomenon of modern totalitarianism, he argued, &#x201c;it was impossible any longer to believe that the values of liberal humanism were self-evident.&#x201d; Humanism needed to be grounded in something higher than a purely material account of the universe, and in something more compelling than the hope of a secular utopia. Only religious premises could support basic liberal concepts like equality and human rights. Only God could ask human beings, as the poet put it, to &#x201c;love their crooked neighbor with all their crooked heart.&#x201d;<br> <br>Auden being Auden, all of this was later summarized in verse, in two stanzas from his 1973 poem &#x201c;Thanksgiving.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Finally, hair-raising things</i><br> <br><i>that Hitler and Stalin were doing</i><br> <br><i>forced me to think about God</i>.<br><br><i>Why was I sure they were wrong?</i><br> <br><i>Wild Kierkegaard, Williams and Lewis</i><br> <br><i>guided me back to belief</i>.<br><br>The details of his pilgrimage were distinctive, but in its broad outlines, Auden&#x2019;s story was emblematic of his era. The disillusionment with the utopias of left and right, the sense of religion as a moral bulwark against totalitarianism, the influence of a generation of brilliant apologists and theologians, even the physical migration from the Old World to the New&#x2014;these elements in Auden&#x2019;s return to Christian faith were also crucial elements in the larger postwar revival of American Christianity, which ushered in a kind of Indian summer for orthodox belief.<br> <br>That age is lost to us now, almost beyond recall. It was the last moment in American life when the churches of the Protestant Mainline still composed something like a religious establishment capable of setting the tone for the culture as a whole. It was a period that saw the reemergence of Evangelical Protestantism as a significant force in American life, trading decades of self-imposed, often-paranoid isolation for cultural engagement and ecumenical revival. It was the peak, in certain ways, of the American Catholic Church, which had passed from a mistrusted immigrant faith to an institution almost unmatched in confidence and prestige, admired even by its fiercest Protestant rivals for the loyalty of its adherents and the vigor of its leaders. Most remarkably, perhaps, it was an era in which the black church, heretofore the most marginal of American Christian traditions, suddenly found itself at the center of the national story and claimed a moral authority unmatched before or since.<br> <br>The strength of Christianity in this era rested on a foundation of swift demographic growth, as the steady, linear increase to which most American churches were accustomed gave way to a surge in membership and attendance that left denominations and parishes struggling to match supply to the newfound demand. In 1940, churchgoing rates hovered around 40 percent; by the late 1950s, they were close to 50 percent. Religious identification increased more rapidly than usual as well, with church membership growing almost twice as fast as population growth. In 1930, 47 percent of Americans were formally affiliated with a church or denomination; the number had risen to 69 percent in 1960. The prestige of religious leaders rose; for example, a poll from 1957 found that 46 percent of Americans described the clergy as the group &#x201c;doing the most good&#x201d; in the nation&#x2019;s common life, easily outstripping politicians, businessmen, and labor leaders. Enrollments in seminaries and Sunday schools increased steadily, and there was a great surge in church construction: Americans spent $26 million on sacred architecture in 1945, $409 million in 1950, and a <i>billion</i> dollars in 1960. &#x201c;Not since the close of the Middle Ages,&#x201d; enthused one of the many advice books pitched to pastors and planning committees, &#x201c;has there been promise of such able advance in the building arts of the church.&#x201d; A British journalist, assessing America in the spirit of Alexis de Tocqueville, remarked that &#x201c;we did not need the evidence of polls and church attendance to confirm what we could so easily observe&#x2014;the walls of new churches rising in town and countryside wherever we went.&#x201d;<br> <br>The popular culture partook of the same revivalist spirit. &#x201c;The theme of religion dominates the non-fiction best sellers,&#x201d; a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> analysis noted in 1953, &#x201c;as it has in many of the preceding years.&#x201d; Scripture sales soared: the distribution of Bibles rose 140 percent between 1949 and 1953. The mutual antagonism between Christians and the entertainment industry lay in the future: From New Testament&#x2013;themed sword-and-sandal epics like <i>The Robe</i> (1953), <i>Ben-Hur</i> (1959), and <i>Barabbas</i> (1961) to Old Testament dramas like <i>The Ten Commandments</i> (1956), spectacle and piety went hand in hand in postwar Hollywood. (Some of the more amusing casting choices from this era include Victor Mature as Samson, Gregory Peck as King David, and a young Joan Collins as Queen Esther.) Catholic influence in the movie industry was particularly potent, visible in the cooperation between motion picture executives and the Church on decency standards&#x2014;the famous/infamous Hays Code was written by a Jesuit theologian&#x2014;and the way that movie stars lined up to play heroic priests and nuns. (For a generation, Charles Morris writes, &#x201c;the Hollywood priest archetype was the &#x2018;superpadre,&#x2019; virile, athletic, compassionate, wise.&#x201d;) One of the first celebrities in the new medium of television was a Catholic bishop, the great popularizer Fulton Sheen, who delivered a prime-time mix of apologetics and moral advice in a full cape, cassock, and pectoral cross. (Upon receiving an Emmy in 1952, he cracked, &#x201c;I wish to thank my four writers&#x2014;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.&#x201d;) It was an era when &#x201c;even the juke boxes and disc jockeys,&#x201d; Sydney Ahlstrom wrote, &#x201c;provided evidence of a change in public attitudes.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Christian renaissance wasn&#x2019;t just a middlebrow affair. Taken on its own, the upsurge in church attendance could be chalked up to purely sociological factors (the return of veterans from war, the growth of the suburbs, the consequences of the baby boom), and the popular culture&#x2019;s religious turn to simple trend-chasing by publishers and movie executives. But there was a shift in the intellectual climate as well, which suggests that something deeper was happening&#x2014;that the experience of the 1930s and 1940s had really prompted a broader reassessment of the modern story, and that the same feelings that had impelled Auden back to Christianity were at work in society as a whole. After the death camps and the gulag, it was harder to credit the naive progressive belief that the modern age represented a long march toward ever-greater enlightenment and peace, or that humanity was capable of relying for salvation on its own capacities alone. Instead, there was a sudden demand for writers who could revise the story that modernity told about itself&#x2014;explaining what had gone wrong, and why, with reference to ideas and traditions that an earlier generation&#x2019;s intelligentsia had dismissed as irrelevant and out-of-date.<br> <br>A host of thinkers answered this call. Not of all them were explicitly religious; their commitments ranged from the idiosyncratic European traditionalism of Eric Voegelin to the antitotalitarian liberalism of Hannah Arendt, from the continental socialism of Theodor Adorno to the very American conservatism of Richard Weaver and Russell Kirk. But they all contributed to a mood of historical and philosophical reassessment, in which the Christian past was mined for insights into the present situation, and the religious vision of a fallen world was suddenly more intellectually respectable than it had been for decades. Western liberalism originally sprang, in many ways, from Christian sources, and in the shadow of totalitarianism, the old Victorian-era debates over Darwinism, biblical criticism, and the like seemed less pressing than they once had, and the commonalities between the two traditions came rushing to the surface. From the halls of the United Nations (where the Catholic philosoper Jacques Maritain played a small but crucial role in the writing of the Declaration on Human Rights) to the streets of the Jim Crow South (where ministers and priests were joining arms with left-wing activists in the name of human brotherhood), the intertwining causes of democracy, civil rights, and anti-Communism provided orthodox Christians and secular liberals with a set of common purposes and a temporary common ground.<br> <br>The result was an era in which religious intellectuals such as C. S. Lewis, Paul Tillich, and John Courtney Murray regularly graced the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine; in which the prolific historians Christopher Dawson and Arnold Toynbee (another <i>Time</i> cover subject) attempted sweeping syntheses of Western history from a Christian point of view; in which the work of writers like William F. Buckley and Whittaker Chambers helped forge a conservative anti-Communism rooted in religious faith.<br> <br>It was a golden age for Christian literature as well, a time when the Anglosphere&#x2019;s three greatest poets (Auden, Eliot, and the young Robert Lowell) were all Christian converts; when Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene were at the height of their powers and Walker Percy and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor were just coming into their own; when Lewis and Tolkien were publishing the twentieth century&#x2019;s two most enduring works of Christian fantasy. Catholicism had been a fossilized substrate in the works of Lost Generation novelists, but the midcentury literary scene was crowded with self-consciously Catholic writers, many of them unjustly neglected today: J. F. Powers, Jean Stafford, Edwin O&#x2019;Connor, Caroline Gordon, Allen Tate, and Walter Miller. And not only novelists; the two greatest spiritual memoirs of the twentieth century were produced within five years of each other, when Thomas Merton&#x2019;s <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> (1948) was followed by Dorothy Day&#x2019;s <i>The Long Loneliness</i> in 1952.<br> <br>Indeed, from the vantage point of the current religious moment, perhaps the most striking features of the midcentury revival are the ways in which mass-market faith and highbrow religiosity seemed to complement each other. The revival meetings in the Bible Belt coincided with what <i>Commentary</i>&#x2019;s Will Herberg called the &#x201c;religious stirring on campus&#x201d;; the surge in church attendance in the heartland was mirrored in a sudden tendency for intellectuals to identify themselves, if not necessarily as believers, then at least as what one journalist termed &#x201c;fellow travelers of faith.&#x201d; As a writer for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> put it in 1954, both &#x201c;the social climate for religious living&#x201d; and &#x201c;the intellectual climate for religious thinking&#x201d; became &#x201c;much more congenial&#x201d; in the years following World War II.<br> <br>Asked to assess &#x201c;the revival of religion,&#x201d; a major American theologian took note of this parallelism: &#x201c;Mass conversions under the ministrations of popular evangelists,&#x201d; he wrote in the Sunday <i>New York Times</i>, were suddenly proceeding at a pace unseen &#x201c;since the days of Billy Sunday.&#x201d; At the same time, there was an unexpected &#x201c;receptivity toward the message of the historic faiths&#x201d; among intellectuals, &#x201c;which is in marked contrast to the indifference or hostility of past decades.&#x201d; Among academic students of religion, especially, a &#x201c;defensive attitude&#x201d; about their subject has given way to a &#x201c;conviction of the importance and relevance of the &#x2018;message&#x2019; of the Bible, as distinguished from the message of, say, Plato, on the one hand, or Herbert Spencer, on the other.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or, as another observer put it: &#x201c;The avante-garde is becoming old-fashioned; religion is the latest thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>A kind of Christian convergence was the defining feature of this era. In the postwar revival, the divided houses of American Christendom didn&#x2019;t just grow, they grew closer together, reengaged with one another after decades of fragmentation and self-segregation.

The issues it tackled, from the failures of the drug war and criminal justice system to systemic bias in law enforcement and other social institutions, have become more urgent and central to the national conversation. The show's actors, such as Idris Elba, Dominic West, and Michael B. Jordan, have gone on to become major stars. Its creators and writers, including David Simon and Richard Price, have developed dedicated cult followings of their own. Universities use the show to teach everything from film theory to criminal justice to sociology. Politicians and activists reference it when discussing policy. When critics compile lists of the Greatest TV Shows of All Time, <i>The Wire</i> routinely takes the top spot. It is arguably one of the great works of art America has produced in the 20th century.<br><br>But while there has been a great deal of critical analysis of the show and its themes, until now there has never been a definitive, behind-the-scenes take on how it came to be made. With unparalleled access to all the key actors and writers involved in its creation, Jonathan Abrams tells the astonishing, compelling, and complete account of <i>The Wire,</i> from its inception and creation through its end and powerful legacy.</p><p><b>Jonathan Abrams </b>is an award-winning journalist who writes for <i>Bleacher Report</i>. He is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Boys Among Men</i>. He was previously a staff writer at <i>Grantland</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i> and is a graduate of the University of Southern California.<p>An Argument of Dissent</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Who the fuck is this guy?</i> Ed Burns thought after David Simon introduced himself in the winter of 1984. The moment would mark the beginning of a collaboration neither could have foreseen, one that would mature into a groundbreaking book and culminate in a revolutionary television show. But first impressions? Burns joked&#x2014;well, partly anyway&#x2014;that he hoped to arrest Simon. Somehow, Simon had finagled his way beyond security and into the Drug Enforcement Administration offices as Burns readied material for a grand jury preparing to bring an indictment against Melvin &#x201c;Little&#x201d; Williams, a disciplined drug trafficker who had successfully flummoxed Baltimore law enforcement for years. Simon told Burns that he was a reporter for The Baltimore Sun and had permission to follow the case. Burns and his partner, Harry Edgerton, both Baltimore police detectives, had finally pinned the elusive Williams through the use of a wiretap. Simon expressed interest in being able to listen in on the wire. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to take you in there, but if I do, that&#x2019;s a ten-year offense and I&#x2019;d love to lock you up,&#x201d; Burns said. He stiff-armed Simon&#x2019;s request, but agreed to meet with him later to discuss the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Who the fuck is this guy? </i>David Simon thought after meeting Burns a second time. Not much time had passed when they greeted one another at the Baltimore County Public Library branch in Towson. Simon had already surmised that Burns did not behave like any typical detective he had come across. He now eyeballed the book titles Burns prepared to check out, Bob Woodward&#x2019;s <i>Veil: Secret Wars of the CIA</i> and <i>The Magus</i>, by John Fowles, among them. &#x201c;I read all the time, and it impressed him,&#x201d; Burns recalled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think David reads anywhere near as much as I do, but a cop reads? My God. I know a lot of cops who read. It was no big deal, but David was a good guy and he had a passion.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That passion unfurled into the canvassing five-part series that Simon wrote on the making and inner workings of Williams as a Baltimore drug trafficker kingpin. For Simon, his life&#x2019;s purpose had been achieved by working at a newspaper. His father, Bernard, had once been a journalist who devoted the bulk of his working days as a public relations director for B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith, the oldest Jewish service organization in the world. His mother, Dorothy, spent time working for an organization that aided students from underachieving public schools to find better education. Simon attended the University of Maryland, where he wrote for the student newspaper, <i>The Diamondback</i>. He joined the <i>Sun</i> after graduating, reporting on crime. To him, being a newspaperman and bringing accountability to influencers meant something. &#x201c;I grew up in a house where we argued politics,&#x201d; Simon recounted. &#x201c;We argued sociology. We argued culture. We argued. It was not personal. Arguing was how you got attention in my family.&#x201d; One of Simon&#x2019;s enduring memories is debating politics with his two uncles as a boy, the moment climaxing with him flatly telling his uncle Hank that he was in the wrong. &#x201c;Who knew he had a brain?&#x201d; Uncle Hank retorted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading Simon&#x2019;s 1987 <i>Sun</i> series, entitled &#x201c; &#x2018;Easy Money&#x2019;: Anatomy of a Drug Empire,&#x201d; is akin to viewing the organs of The Wire&#x2019;s first-season wiretap investigation. Williams was a self-made entrepreneur who imported the bulk of Baltimore&#x2019;s heroin influx as the city&#x2019;s honest economic opportunities shifted and dwindled. &#x201c;An imperious, intelligent man who chooses words with care,&#x201d; Simon described &#x201c;Melvin Williams refuses to be stereotyped. Street sales of narcotics were routinely punctuated by murderous violence, but Williams was a family man, devoted to an eleven-year marriage and two young daughters.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Williams conducted most of his business through his number two, a consigliere named Lamont &#x201c;Chin&#x201d; Farmer. Farmer orchestrated both a simple and intricate communication system involving the use of beepers. He also headed a print shop and took business courses at a community college, � la Idris Elba&#x2019;s Stringer Bell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon&#x2019;s series meticulously captured Williams&#x2019;s life and downfall&#x2014;not only as a drug kingpin, but also as a respected figure in the community, where, as Simon wrote, &#x201c;he was hailed as Little Melvin, the Citizen, speaking at the request of National Guard officials during the 1968 riots, urging a restless crowd to go home.&#x201d; Burns appreciated that Simon showed all facets of the case and offered a depiction of Williams that was beyond a caricature. &#x201c;When the case came down, he wrote a very good article because he went out and saw some of the gangsters and it was a most balanced article,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;I liked that.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon spent Christmas Eve 1986 on an overnight shift with the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit for another story shortly before the series on Williams debuted. During that night, a detective mentioned that someone could write a damn good book if they documented the department&#x2019;s happenings for a year. With the permission of Police Commissioner Edward Tilghman, Simon gained complete access to be a fly on the wall with the unit, despite the objections of some of the department&#x2019;s personnel. &#x201c;A captain had a vote,&#x201d; said Jay Landsman, then a homicide detective sergeant, who also lent his name and acting abilities to The Wire. &#x201c;He took a poll of who wanted to do it and who didn&#x2019;t. Twenty-eight out of thirty of us, including myself, voted against it. We worked murders in the ghetto. You lived in a gray area with that. It doesn&#x2019;t always look pretty. Everything we did was legal, but it was kind of how were they going to interpret it? So, naturally, since they had a democratic election and we all voted against it, they gave him the go-ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon took a leave from <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>, becoming a &#x201c;police intern&#x201d; in January 1988. Members of the department playfully hazed him until he proved game for the task. He gained enough insight into the minds of the squad members that some later acknowledged that he had accurately captured words and feelings they had never verbally expressed. Houghton Mifflin published <i>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</i> in June 1991. The book, like the series on Williams, is peppered with scenes later extracted for <i>The Wire</i>. In it, Simon provides a penetrating portrait of how the detectives attempted to unravel murder cases and the humanistic toll it took on them. &#x201c;It was daily that we told him if he printed anything we didn&#x2019;t like, we would kill him,&#x201d; Landsman said. &#x201c;But he grinned at everything. As it turns out, we weren&#x2019;t as bad as we thought we would be portrayed by David.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ed Burns, working another prolonged investigation, scarcely figured into the book. He was already grappling with the limits of how little one outside-the-box thinker could influence a lurching institution. &#x201c;We were like family,&#x201d; Landsman said. &#x201c;But [Burns] was the biggest pain in the ass in the world. He once said everybody in police should have a bachelor&#x2019;s or master&#x2019;s degree. I said, &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;d all be like you. That would be hell, because you&#x2019;re an asshole.&#x2019; It was all in fun, but he played to his own drummer. When you really needed something done, you had to just put your foot down on it. But he was tenacious as hell, a little bit gullible. Like that informant Bubbles that he had. I wouldn&#x2019;t believe Bubbles as far as I could throw him. A broken clock is right at least twice a day, and I guess that&#x2019;s the two times he gave Burns good information.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Burns left the police force, having knocked his head against his superiors for much of his two decades as a patrolman, plainclothesman, and detective. He was about to start his new life as a middle school teacher when Simon proposed a collaboration. Simon&#x2019;s book editor, John Sterling, suggested that the proper follow-up to Homicide would be observing a drug corner in Baltimore for a year and depicting the story&#x2019;s previously undocumented other side of addicts. Burns agreed to contribute, and the two settled on the intersection of West Baltimore&#x2019;s Fayette and Monroe. For weeks, Burns spent his days gaining the confidence of dealers and users, while Simon worked at the newspaper before taking a second leave. &#x201c;The badge can get you under that yellow tape, but it can&#x2019;t get you into their shooting galleries and places like that,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;I could sit down on the third floor of a shooting gallery with five or six guys pumping all around me, a prostitute working out in the bed over there, and have a conversation. Every once in a while, they take the syringe off [from behind] their ear, get a little hit, put it back on, and it would be a conversation where you knew that these people were aware of what was going on and how they had been sucked into this trap.&#x201d; As he had in Homicide, Simon displayed a perceptive ear in deciphering the corner&#x2019;s dialogue. He had to learn the appropriate jokes to laugh at, when to show concern, when to blend in, or when to pop up with a question. Homicide was heavily saturated with cop jargon&#x2014;a red ball, a whodunit, dunkers. <i>The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood </i>was published in 1997 and introduced the reader to a new vocabulary, with words such as testers, the snake, and speedballs. The piercing narrative focused on the McCullough family and their efforts to function as a unit even as they dealt with the toll drugs extracted from them. Gary McCullough, the father, had been a businessman who fell into the throes of addiction once his marriage to Fran Boyd crumbled. Boyd, also addicted to drugs at the time, still tried mapping a better life for her sons. They included DeAndre McCullough, who, at the age of fifteen, had already begun peddling drugs. (DeAndre would go on to work on the set of The Wire and portray Lamar, Brother Mouzone&#x2019;s dim associate, before his death at the age of thirty-five in 2012.) Some, including a few inside The Baltimore Sun, accused Simon of ennobling and romanticizing drug dealers and users. In truth, the book offered a voice to those who had been left behind as forgotten casualties of the war on drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon originally did not think much of the deal when the Baltimore-born director Barry Levinson bought the rights to <i>Homicide</i> and plotted to develop it into a TV show for NBC. Simon passed on an offer to write the show&#x2019;s pilot&#x2014;he just hoped that a television show would help sell a few more copies of the book. He accepted a subsequent offer from showrunner Tom Fontana to write another episode and teamed with his college friend David Mills to author an episode that would premiere the show&#x2019;s second season in 1994. The episode, titled &#x201c;Bop Gun,&#x201d; guest-starred Robin Williams and won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay of an Episodic Drama. The experience left Simon unsated. Only half of what he and Mills had written, Simon estimated, prevailed in the final script. While Mills departed for Hollywood soon after, Simon returned to the newspaper, satisfied to spend the rest of his working days arguing with his feet up and bumming cigarettes off younger reporters. But the paper, his paper, started feeling more unfamiliar. It had been purchased in 1986 by the Times Mirror Company. Buyouts cut into the depth and experience of the newsroom. Simon felt that the new top editors placed an unwarranted emphasis on claiming journalism prizes rather than covering the mundane issues plaguing Baltimore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simon accepted a buyout, jumping full time to the staff of <i>Homicide</i>. Under Fontana and producer/writer James Yoshimura, he learned how to transfer his journalistic skills into writing for television. It was Fontana who mentored Simon, telling him that a writer becomes a producer in order to protect his words. Some of the cast and crew dreaded whenever Simon arrived on set. They knew they would be pelted with questions, and they tried avoiding eye contact with him. &#x201c;It was questions with wardrobe,&#x201d; said Jeffrey Pratt Gordon, who worked in the art department of Homicide before acting as Johnny &#x201c;Fifty&#x201d; Spamanto in The Wire&#x2019;s Season 2. &#x201c;It was questions with the cinematographer. He was asking everybody questions, and a lot of the times that he asked the questions is right when we&#x2019;re sort of in the middle of doing stuff. What&#x2019;s this guy poking around for? What&#x2019;s this guy always asking questions about?&#x201d; It was only years later that he surmised Simon had been educating himself in every aspect of filmmaking. Still, television did not entirely appeal to Simon. He had left the newspaper but remained an arguer, one ready to rail against the status quo. The Washington Post tried hiring him, and he mulled over the offer. It was not until Fontana showed him something else that he had been working on, a pilot for a prison drama shot for HBO named Oz, that Simon visualized television as a worthwhile megaphone. Oz painted a grim world where the initial concerns would not consist of who won and who lost or cleanly separate the bad guys from the good guys. Simon contemplated whether something like The Corner could be adapted for television. Through Fontana, he gained an audience with HBO. He pitched them on what would have been <i>The Wire</i>, telling Burns, &#x201c;If HBO&#x2019;s interested in this world, we could write a fictional show.&#x201d; The HBO executives Chris Albrecht, Anne Thomopoulos, and Kary Antholis looked at one another. &#x201c;Just do the book,&#x201d; Antholis said. &#x201c;Just do the characters in the book. You have six hours. It&#x2019;s a miniseries.&#x201d; HBO, Simon thought, would need a black writer associated with the project. He floated the possibility of attaching David Mills. The name appealed to the executives but left no place for Burns. Instead, Simon asked Burns to begin outlining the fictionalized world. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t like what happened because David was not forthcoming,&#x201d; Burns said. &#x201c;He believed he needed a black writer on the show. They wanted me to do another script as if there was going to be seven episodes instead of the six, which was totally not going to happen. They took me out to a restaurant and they fumbled through this, &#x2018;We were thinking about this and that,&#x2019; and I&#x2019;m thinking to myself, You guys, there would be no Corner, because David wasn&#x2019;t going to go out there by himself. I was more than happy to go out because I liked the experience. I liked to do things like that. David waited until it was safe to go out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decision to commit to <i>The Corner,</i> recalled Chris Albrecht, HBO&#x2019;s chairman and CEO, came down to a choice between Simon&#x2019;s project or an adaptation of Taylor Branch&#x2019;s work on the civil rights movement. He took scripts from both on a cross-country plane ride. Albrecht opened The Corner first. Oh man, that&#x2019;s so depressing, he thought. No one is going to want to watch this. He picked up Branch&#x2019;s scripts. He found them entertaining, but his mind wandered back to The Corner, wondering what would happen next. He picked it up again and sifted through the next few pages. This is too intense, he thought. It&#x2019;s just so intense and so raw. The same scenario played out a few more times. As worthwhile as the Taylor Branch project was, anybody could do that, he finally decided. Only HBO could do<i> The Corner</i>.</p></p><h2>Murder at Hartigan House: a cozy historical mystery (A Ginger Gold Mystery)</h2><p><p></p><p><b>&#x201c;Clever and entertaining, you&#x2019;ll love this charming Golden Age mystery series.

Featuring distinct Jewish and Christian voices in respectful conversation, Amy-Jill Levine and Ben Witherington, III methodologically break new ground in exploring why scholars disagree on questions of history (what actually happened, what is authorial invention, how do we address different versions of the same account), literature (what does this story tell us about Jesus and Peter, Mary Magdalene and Judas, among other characters), and theology (what can we say about resurrection and divine justice, or about Jesus as the Messiah). They show how Luke has been used to create both tragedy and hope, as well as to promote sexism, anti-semitism, and religious intolerance, thereby raising important questions regarding ethically responsible interpretation. This volume will be essential reading for theologians, clergy, and anyone interested in biblical studies and Jewish/Christian dialogue.</p><p>This book is for anyone interested in the Gospel of Luke. It shows why and how biblical scholars disagree on questions of historicity, theology, and literary features, on how the Gospel text has been used to create both tragedy and hope.

From college chess games to a game of life and death. It was surreal to say the least. In this book I pour my heart out and bare my soul to tell you what that was like, from basic to Vietnam and back. <p></p> <p><b>Synopsis</b></p> In the summer of 1967, Mark Garrison had dropped out of college at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, just before entering his third year. He had run out of money and had to work for a while. These were the days before the lottery and the draft soon came calling. In order to somewhat control his own future, he enlisted in the U.S. Army&#x2019;s helicopter flight school program. Little did he know that this adventure would be the most profound experience of his life. <p></p> Garrison flew hundreds of missions for the 119th AHC, stationed in the Central Highlands at Camp Holloway in Pleiku, Vietnam. He was awarded twenty-five Air Medals, four campaign Bronze Stars, and The Distinguished Flying Cross among numerous other awards. His narrative takes you through the whole process, from basic training, flight school, flying combat in Vietnam, and his return to the United States. His description includes many incidents in combat flight, including being hit by rocket propelled grenades and being on fire in the air, over hundreds if not thousands of enemy troops. But this is not all. He elaborates on the daily lives, emotions, and nuances of the pilots and what they considered their mission to be. <p></p> <em><strong>GUTS 'N GUNSHIPS</strong></em> is a must read if you are to have a realistic understanding of what flying helicopters in Vietnam combat was all about. <p></p> <p><b>Review</b></p> &#x201c;Mark Garrison&#x2019;s Guts 'N Gunships is more than just another Vietnam flashback.

After just a few months training, he found himself in the mountains of Vietnam flying Huey helicopters into small holes in the triple canopy jungle. He had been assigned to duty with the Crocodiles and Alligators of the 119th Assault Helicopter Company, just a few short miles from the dreaded Ho Chi Minh Trail. <p></p> His one year recounting of his numbered days there is painted with blood, pathos and hilarious incidents, stemming from hard drinking and furious nap of the earth flying, while the helicopters were blown apart with the pilots and crews in them. <p></p> Most uplifting of all is the author&#x2019;s first person accounting of a unit of pilots who saw the American mission failing but renewed vows among themselves that they would give the enemy no quarter and would cut no corners in their attempts to bring home alive every American they possibly could. <p></p> No one has ever before addressed the American helicopter pilot experience in the way Garrison does.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ron Gawthorp</p><p>Mark V.

Born in northern India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.</p><h2>Timaeus and Critias (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Timaeus and Critias is a Socratic dialogue in two parts.

Timaeus introduces the idea of a creator God and speculates on the structure and composition of the physical world. Critias, the second part of Plato&#x2019;s dialogue, comprises an account of the rise and fall of Atlantis, an ancient, mighty and prosperous empire ruled by the descendents of Poseidon, which ultimately sank into the sea.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

When we are awake we identify with our body, but if we let our mind wander or daydream, we project a mentally imagined self into the remembered past or anticipated future. As we fall asleep, the impression of being a bounded self distinct from the world dissolves, but the self reappears in the dream state. If we have a lucid dream, we no longer identify only with the self within the dream. Our sense of self now includes our dreaming self, the "I" as dreamer. Finally, as we meditate&#x2015;either in the waking state or in a lucid dream&#x2015;we can observe whatever images or thoughts arise and how we tend to identify with them as "me." We can also experience sheer awareness itself, distinct from the changing contents that make up our image of the self. <br><br>Contemplative traditions say that we can learn to let go of the self, so that when we die we can witness its dissolution with equanimity. Thompson weaves together neuroscience, philosophy, and personal narrative to depict these transformations, adding uncommon depth to life's profound questions. Contemplative experience comes to illuminate scientific findings, and scientific evidence enriches the vast knowledge acquired by contemplatives.</p><p>Evan Thompson is professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He is the author of<i>Colour Vision: A Study in Cognitive Science and the Philosophy of Perception </i>(1995) and<i> Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind</i> (2007) and coauthor of <i>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</i> (1991, revised edition, 2017).In a game-changing book that is both an intellectual tour de force and the courageous statement of a life's ideal, Thompson brilliantly demonstrates how Indian philosophical thought can join forces with the neurosciences to create a new science of the conscious mind. A must-read for anyone who believes that the future of philosophy is crosscultural. (Jonardon Ganeri, University of Sussex and the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London)<br><br>Evan Thompson, a philosopher with a deep knowledge of Indo-Tibetan contemplative traditions and modern neuroscience, has written a brilliant and comprehensive book on the nature of awareness and the self. <i>Waking, Dreaming, Being</i> is a dazzling synthesis. Thompson takes on some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of mind and addresses them with remarkable creativity and clarity. This volume is a must read for any serious student of the mind and consciousness. (Richard J. Davidson, New York Times-bestselling coauthor of <i>The Emotional Life of Your Brain</i>)<br><br>Drawing on multiple sources of knowledge, all tested by first-person experience and critical analysis, Thompson presents an illuminating neurophenomenological account of what it's like to be a conscious human being. (Stephen LaBerge, author of <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i>)<br><br><i>Waking, Dreaming, Being</i> powerfully demonstrates how bringing cognitive science, philosophy, and Buddhism into a critical engagement can open innovative ways of exploring the 'hard problem' of consciousness. The blending of philosophical rigor and scientific knowledge with meditative insights, with the author's own remarkable life as the larger background, makes the book a real joy to read. This book will be an invaluable help to anyone who is interested in knowing how the fundamental questions of self, consciousness, and human existence can be explored in a way that combines the best of both East and West. (Thupten Jinpa, author of <i>Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan Philosophy</i>)<br><br>With extensive training in Buddhism, brain science, and phenomenology, Evan Thompson is uniquely positioned to reveal how different perspectives on the mind can be mutually illuminating. He begins with the Buddhist insight that there are many forms of consciousness--far more than traditionally recognized in the West--and he shows that these can be associated with deferent brain processes. The result is a richly original and integrated account of human mental life. Whether you are a curious newcomer or a seasoned expert, you have much to learn from this stunning synthesis of ancient wisdom and cutting-edge science.

Can you help them find what they are looking for?</p> <p><em>Who Counts?</em> is a creative retelling of three popular parables: the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son. As young readers count to help the characters find what's missing, <em>Who Counts?</em> teaches that every one of us counts in God's eyes and that everyone should feel counted.</p> <p>The stories are beautifully illustrated with modern-day characters and a diversity of ethnicities so that all children will be able to see themselves in the stories.</p> <p><em>Who Counts?</em> is featured on the Junior Library Guild Fall 2017 list.</p></p><p><p><strong>Amy-Jill Levine</strong>, the author of numerous acclaimed books, is University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies, Mary Jane Werthan Professor of Jewish Studies, and Professor of New Testament Studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School and College of Arts and Science. <em>Who Counts?</em> and <em>The Marvelous Mustard Seed</em>, her first two children's books cowritten with Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, were named Junior Library Guild Selections.</p>^<p><strong>Sandy Eisenberg Sasso</strong> is the Director of Religion, Spirituality and the Arts Initiative at Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) Arts and Humanities Institute, as well as Rabbi Emerita of Congregation Beth-El Zedeck.

She is a member of the Society of Children&#x2019;s Book Writers and Illustrators and the illustrator of the popular children&#x2019;s books <em>Who Counts? 100 Sheep, 10 Coins, and 2 Sons</em> and <em>The Marvelous Mustard Seed.</em></p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;Three of Jesus's parables from the New Testament are retold here with a secular twist. Each parable is about something or someone lost: a sheep, a coin, and a son. In scripture, human repentance and God's forgiveness are integral to these stories; however, repentance and forgiveness are not mentioned in the sheep or coin parable, and references to God and Jesus are omitted overall. A note to teachers and parents in the back of the book reads, "Our presentation of these parables does not intend to erase the focus on repenting and forgiving. Rather, we seek to add a new understanding based on what we imagine Jesus' original audiences would have heard." The strongest story is that of the prodigal son, and the weakest is the one about the lost coin (when the woman finds her lost coin, she puts it back with her "coin collection," making it look as if the coins did not represent her life savings, but only a hobby). The narratives are light and conversational in tone. Some passages have a storyteller's cadence. For example, when the shepherd goes to look for his lost sheep, "he looked to the right. Nothing. He walked and listened. Still nothing. Then he heard it: a bleating sound." Meganck's use of color and soft lines is similar to Tomie dePaola's style.

Her selection of subjects includes the prominent (Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and Shirley Chisholm) as well as such lesser-knowns as Fannie Lou Hamer, an indefatigable campaigner for African-Americans' right to vote. Pinkney's writing is spiced with colloquialisms ("She didn't shy back for nobody," she says of Sojourner Truth) and useful imagery (describing this same crusader's delivery of her renowned "Ain't I a woman?" speech, the author notes, "She was the only black woman in the place, and when she stepped to the pulpit, some folks looked at her like she was a stain on their purest linens"). Featuring creatively skewed perspective and proportion, Alcorn's (<i>I, Too, Sing America</i>) oil paintings offer allegorical interpretations of his subjects' lives." <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <b><p></p></b>"Engaging text and glorious art are combined in this collection of sketches celebrating the contributions of 10 women who moved forward the cause of civil rights in America. Following a preface that describes her own family roots in the civil rights movement and their influence on her, Pinkney presents her heroines chronologically, from Sojourner Truth to Shirley Chisholm, in verbal portraits that capture the subjects' spirit and personalities amid biographical highlights. Blending straightforward narrative with a lively storytelling style, the author balances the hardships and racial injustice that these women faced against their faith, strength of character, and determination. They include Harriet Tubman, Mary McLeod Bethune, and Rosa Parks, as well as Biddy Mason, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Ella Josephine Baker, Dorothy Irene Height, and Fannie Lou Hamer. The book includes many quotes, incidents, and details that lead readers down their personal paths to historical recognition. However, it is Alcorn's vibrant, inspired oil paintings that make this book a standout. A full-page stylized portrait appears opposite the first page of each story; it is filled with symbolic details that are elucidated in the text. A brilliant example is a larger-than-life Harriet Tubman balanced on one knee over a railroad track with arms diagonally outstretched, bridgelike, as tiny travelers make their way up the steep height toward the freedom star. Smaller paintings appear within the stories, carrying the message further. Line, color, and canvas texture give the pictures depth and dynamism, vastly enriching the reading experience.

Walk on water? Stick out your tongue? Play dead? Animals in the wild use all kinds of methods to protect themselves from their enemies. Using dynamic and intricate cut-paper collages, Steve Jenkins explores the many fascinating and unique defense mechanisms creatures use to escape from danger.</p><p><p><b>Steve Jenkins </b>has written and illustrated many nonfiction picture books for young readers, including the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>What Do You Do with a Tail Like This?</i> His books have been called stunning, eye-popping, inventive, gorgeous, masterful, extraordinary, playful, irresistible, compelling, engaging, accessible, glorious, and informative. He lives in Boulder, Colorado with his wife and frequent collaborator, Robin Page.<br> www.stevejenkinsbooks.com</p>The art of camouflage works on several levels here: Jenkins (Big and Little, 1996, etc.) cleverly conceals a factual compendium of 14 animal and insect defenses as a colorful picture book. Predators are depicted in pursuit of prey on each right-hand side of the spread; a flip of the page uncovers the clever escape mechanism employed by the would-be victim, from the bombardier beetle that can spray hot chemicals up to 500 times a second, to the glass snake that conveniently segments its tail. Whether curling up into an armor-plated ball, squirting clouds of ink, or imitating a leaf, the tricksters are described in a couple of sentences that invite further investigation of these survival techniques. Layered cut-paper collage animals are positioned in dramatic stances against textured handmade-paper backgrounds. In a few instances, the black typeface is difficult to discern when it is superimposed on the dark green of leaf or grass. One final question, ``What would you do if something wanted to eat you?'' takes readers into their own cat-and-mouse scenarios. A dashing look at natural escape routes.

Whether he is entering a race, trick-or-treating, or trying to impress his new neighbor, Fox adds his own special touch. His plans may not work out the way he expects them to, but he always has fun.</p><p>James Marshall was&nbsp;one of the most prolific and successful author/illustrators of children's books. He was best known for his series on the mischievous exploits of Fox, a debonair, lazy showoff; the uproarious adventures of the two Cut-Ups, Spud and Joe; George and Martha; and the misadventures of the Stupidfamily.&nbsp;He divided his time between an apartment in the Chelsea district of New York and his home in Mansfield Hollow Connecticut.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- Fox is lightning quick and mighty clever at attempting to make things turn out in his favor. Here he is foiled three times when his attempts to come out on top backfire, and he's never been funnier. There will be no sympathy for him when he tries to win a race illegally; when he's wooed into giving away his ten best comics; and when he is tricked into believing in Halloween magic. With its straightforward plot and dialogue, Marshall's text is just right for new readers. Most of the humor comes from the delightful pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations--great facial expressions (appearing so simply created with lines and dots) and often funny poses of characters. Fox (is) Outfoxed again, and beginning readers are the big winners. --Gale W.

How did the women&#x2019;s movement, which fought for equal opportunity for women in education and the workplace, and the sexual revolution, which reduced women to ambitious sex objects, become so united?</p><p>In <i>Subverted, </i>Sue Ellen Browder documents for the first time how it all happened, in her own life and in the life of an entire country. Trained at the University of Missouri School of Journalism to be an investigative journalist, Browder unwittingly betrayed her true calling and became a propagandist for sexual liberation. As a long-time freelance writer for <i>Cosmopolitan </i>magazine, she wrote pieces meant to soft-sell unmarried sex, contraception, and abortion as the single woman&#x2019;s path to personal fulfillment. She did not realize until much later that propagandists higher and cleverer than herself were influencing her thinking and her personal choices as they subverted the women&#x2019;s movement.</p><p>The thirst for truth, integrity, and justice for women that led Browder into journalism in the first place eventually led her to find forgiveness and freedom in the place she least expected to find them. Her in-depth research, her probing analysis, and her honest self-reflection set the record straight and illumine a way forward for others who have suffered from the unholy alliance between the women&#x2019;s movement and the sexual revolution.</p></p><p><p><b>Sue Ellen Browder </b>is a freelance writer who has appeared on <i>Oprah</i>, the <i>Today Show</i>, and hundreds of radio talk shows.

These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called &#34;incremental development and continual review.&#34; Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Algebra 1, third edition is made up of five instructional components: Introduction of the New Increment, Examples with Complete Solutions, Practice of the Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. Algebra 1 covers topics typically treated in a first-year algebra course. This set contains a student text, answer key, and test forms. A solutions manual is available separately.

The Pawtuxet Indians thought of it as the Green Corn Dance. But the first Thanksgiving was much more than that. <br><br>Join Newbery Medalist Jean Craighead George and beloved illustrator Thomas Locker as they trace the passage of time from the melting of the glaciers that created Cape Cod and Plymouth Rock, to the moment the Pawtuxet Indians and the Pilgrims met and feasted on the bounty of the New World. <br><br>From the simple text to the lush illustrations, the story of a harvest feast turned beloved tradition will captivate readers young and old.<br><br> &#x201c;Correcting misconceptions and clarifying contemporary attitudes, this beautiful book brings fresh insight and a fairer balance to the traditional story.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p><b>Jean Craighead George</b> (1919&#x2013;2012) was the author of more than 100 beloved books for young people, including the Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<i>Julie of the Wolves</i>&nbsp;and the Newbery Honor&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<i>My Side of the Mountain</i>. She was a lifetime naturalist and was beloved by generations of nature-loving children. Two of her children, Craig and Twig, helped complete her last novel.<br><br><b>Thomas Locker</b> has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the companion titles W<i>ater Dance</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mountain Dance</i>. He lives in Stuyvesant, New York.Grade 2-5-- George's consummate skill as a storyteller takes what could have been "just another" Thanksgiving book and raises it above the mundane. Beginning "in a time so long ago that only the rocks remember," she focuses on Plymouth Rock, a 200-ton boulder of Dedham granite, as the loom upon which to weave the heroic and tragic tales of the people who settled this land. The storytelling is direct, filled with details, and firmly grounded in place and time. Quickly drawn but very effective portraits of the times and the people heighten the presentation. Squanto's tragedy is movingly sketched. Readers will not miss the ironic contrast between the fate of the native population and those who came seeking a freer, more tolerant life, but George does not belabor the point, letting the events of history subtly underscore the irony. Locker is at his best with panoramic landscapes--the icy desolation of the melting glaciers; the storm-tossed ship on the ocean voyage; and the isolation of the place where the Pilgrims must bury their dead under cover of darkness, lest the "savages" know how many of them died. For all their attractiveness, however, the illustrations fail to match George's strong narrative with equal visual strength. The panoramic view distances readers from the events, softening the impact of the physical hardships and emotional pain inherent in the story. Whatever its minor flaws, though, this is a book most libraries will want to add to their collections. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Three Stories You Can Read to Your Dog</h2><p>Does your dog sleep a lot? Maybe he or she is bored. Why not try reading these three stories to your dog? Accompanied by lively illustrations, they are all about the things dogs understand best -- burglars, bones, and running free.</p><p>Sara Swan Miller is the author of <i>Three Stories You Can Read To Your Dog</i>, <i>Three Stories You Can Read To Your Cat</i>, <i>Three More Stories You Can Read To Your Dog</i>, <i>Three More Stories You Can Read To Your Cat</i>, and<i> Three Stories You Can Read To Your Teddy Bear</i>.<br><br>True Kelley has illustrated many books for children, including Stay! Keeper's Story by Lois Lowry. She lives with children's author Steven Lindblom and their daughter, Jada, in Warner, New Hampshire."When you feel bored, you read a book. But dogs can't read," Miller points out. Lest people have all the fun, she's designed this chapter book with canine sensibilities in mind. Each tale is addressed to "you good dog," enabling readers to speak directly to a pet. "The Burglar" testifies to the fierceness and bravery "you" exhibit after hearing a knock on the door; "The Bone" chronicles the history of a gift from "your friend," including a dream sequence about a splendid "bone tree"); and "The Wild Dog" is an adventure in which "you" frighten a car, chase a squirrel and triumphantly return home for a can of food and a nap. Kelley (I Really Want a Dog) sketches a floppy brown Everydog who wags attentively at the narrator's voice, then enacts each role of eating, sleeping and protecting the house; the illustrator's familiarity with doggy expressions and gestures serves Miller's volume well. Humans will find these selections entertaining even without a hound present-but it's always nice to share.

Maybe you&#x2019;re wondering if you&#x2019;re actually reading the right book. You probably read the title and picked it up thinking world domination sounded like a pretty good idea, but then you opened it up and&#x2014;what the ... ?&#x2014;the title of the first part seems to contradict the title of the book! Yes, I am tricksy. What were you expecting? This ain&#x2019;t no textbook. We need to understand each other before we go any further: I operate in one way and one way only&#x2014;always in your face, but on your side. Copy? OK, so, let&#x2019;s clear the air. You are asking, &#x201c;Josh, are you actually contradicting the title of your book in the first paragraph?&#x201d; Yes, I am. Onward ...)<br>When I was just a little boy wonder, there was this cartoon called Animaniacs. You probably don&#x2019;t remember it, but the show featured a recurring segment called &#x201c;Pinky and the Brain&#x201d; about two genetically enhanced lab mice: Pinky, an idiot, and Brain, a diabolical genius much like yourself. Every episode began with these two lines of dialogue:<br><br>Pinky: Gee, Brain, what are we going to do tonight?<br>Brain: The same thing we do every night, Pinky: Try to take over the world!<br><br>And try they did. Using all manner of cunning schemes and high-tech absurdities, Brain&#x2014;with often disastrous &#x201c;help&#x201d; from Pinky&#x2014;would mastermind a plan for total world domination.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t just &#x201c;Pinky and the Brain.&#x201d; Every show I grew up on, from Care Bears (did I just admit to watching Care Bears?) to Masters of the Universe (much more manly) to Transformers, had a villain trying to subjugate the other characters. (Confession: I don&#x2019;t even know what &#x201c;subjugate&#x201d; means, but my book editor told me not to talk down to teens and to challenge them with big words. Well, I have challenged myself and failed. I am crying right now.) These villains went by names like Professor Coldheart, Skeletor, Megatron, and Monty Burns. They often emitted evil, cackling laughs. They nearly all had henchmen, and sometimes they had mustaches ... which stirred up jealousy in me due to my complete inability to grow facial hair, even to this day. Tear.<br>Fast-forward to today: Dark wizard Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters terrorize humanity in the Harry Potter series; the merciless Volturi cause trouble for Bella in the Twilight saga; and, after all these years, Decepticon overlord Megatron is still bent on destroying Earth and everyone on it. All of these villains&#x2014;and every villain from our books to the big screen&#x2014;are after the same thing: Absolute power, complete control, and total world domination.<br>But power-hungry villains aren&#x2019;t just the stuff of fiction. In fact, the villain&#x2019;s quest for world domination is a classic case of art imitating life. When I was in school, the only homework my foster parents could ever force my ADD brain to focus on was history, particularly the stories about real-world dudes who built vast empires&#x2014;like the Egyptian pharaohs, Xerxes I, and countless other emperors, kings, queens, warlords, generals, and dictators. Let me tell you, actual history is really just a big soap opera of crazy people trying to take over the world. But here&#x2019;s what I discovered. These historical figures&#x2014;from Hitler to Napol�on to Genghis Khan to Alexander the Great&#x2014;all had one thing in common:<br>(Actually, they had a lot in common&#x2014;egos the size of Texas, an insatiable thirst for power and wealth, a common serial killer&#x2019;s disregard for human life&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m talking about besides that.)<br>None of them ever succeeded. That&#x2019;s right, not one.<br>Sure, they had people running scared for a while, and some of these guys conquered huge chunks of territory. But no matter how big their army, how prosperous their economy, how abundant their resources, how advanced their technology, how brilliant their devious plan, or how epically bushy their facial hair (I&#x2019;m looking at you, Genghis) ... they could never quite pull it off. Their empires always crumbled.<br>To this day, no one has been able to take over the entire world&#x2014;not in cartoons, not in books, not in movies, and definitely not in history!<br>// Yet the villains keep trying<br>Despite the dismal track record of ambitious tyrants who&#x2019;ve tried and died before them, modern-day villains remain fascinated by and fixated on their personal quests for world domination. Ancient rulers tried to conquer the world in search of mythical items like the fountain of youth, gold (btw, what&#x2019;s with all those gold-bar infomercials on TV after 2 A.M.?), or ultimate glory. But these days, it&#x2019;s usually about political power, natural resources, weapons, and cold hard cash. It seems that everyone is looking for that magical force or item that will allow them to control everyone else or give them a leg up in the race of world domination.<br>Fortunately, the vast majority of these selfish and destructive individuals won&#x2019;t become rulers of nations or commanders of armies. But, something you need to understand is that it doesn&#x2019;t take an army, a giant moon-laser, or a mustache to try to control others&#x2019; lives.<br>Would-be villains are still out to dominate other people&#x2019;s worlds every day, and I&#x2019;m not just talking about national security or terrorist threats. Lean in for this one:<br>Your world is under attack by an assortment of villains right here and right now.<br>I&#x2019;m serious! Through manipulation and physical strength or through passive-aggressiveness and psychological warfare, there are villains in your life today trying to control your world for their own gain.<br>Let me be clear to make sure you heard me. The villains are real and they are coming for you. But if you don&#x2019;t believe me, this book isn&#x2019;t going to make any sense to you and you&#x2019;re not going to last.<br>In fact, there may be villains among us right now, even reading this book. Are you a villain? Are you? Huh? Don&#x2019;t look away from the page&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not kidding, here. Think about it, you DID pick up a book called The Teen&#x2019;s Guide to World Domination! YOU might actually be a villain trying to control others&#x2019; lives for your own gain. But let&#x2019;s be honest, I don&#x2019;t entirely blame you: World domination does have a certain appeal, doesn&#x2019;t it? Even to noble citizens like us.<br>Sure, people like you and me probably don&#x2019;t really aspire to overthrow governments or create secret lairs guarded by sharks with lasers on their heads in order to bring small nations to their knees while our merciless conquest is broadcast live on CNN with Larry King (the emperor of suspenders). In my experience, most people don&#x2019;t want to do that. Most people aren&#x2019;t psychotic megalomaniacs. (Ooh ... &#x201c;megalomaniac&#x201d;! How&#x2019;s that for challenging teens? I think it means either a crazy person or something about breeding giant LEGO blocks; I heard it on a random AM radio station and it seemed to work here.)<br>The idea of getting other people to do what we want ... well, that sounds kinda fancy, doesn&#x2019;t it? But trust me, controlling other people isn&#x2019;t fancy. It&#x2019;s awful, and you and I both know your grandmother would be ashamed of you if she knew you were doing this.<br>Beneath the surface, grandiose (how do you like them apples, editor?) plans to dominate the world are usually about something far less impressive. Often, it&#x2019;s because we want something and we&#x2019;re not willing to play nice to get it. We don&#x2019;t feel good about who we are, so, to get what we want, we have to knock someone else down. We don&#x2019;t feel powerful, so we find someone weaker to control. That&#x2019;s what happened with Napol�on and Hitler. And take a look at Kim Jong Il from North Korea! That dude is 5?3?; talk about a complex! He just got extremely good at controlling people and started wearing platform shoes to appear more manly. (I must say that I understand his pain, being just 5?8? myself; I often refer to myself as a &#x201c;man-boy.&#x201d;) But whether you are short or tall, taking advantage of those weaker than you is just plain wrong.<br>Bottom line: The traditional quest for total world domination NEVER succeeds, it USUALLY stems from ugly motives, and ALWAYS, without a doubt, hurts other people.<br>It&#x2019;s time to recognize that the quest for total world domination isn&#x2019;t all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be. It&#x2019;s time to choose a new battle, set a new goal. Instead of trying to conquer a small country or even just conquering your own high school classroom, let&#x2019;s leave everyone else alone for a while and focus on something else, something that is actually doable!<br>Here&#x2019;s the thing: There&#x2019;s a bigger, more important challenge out there and we&#x2019;ve all overlooked it. Any coward can try to control someone else&#x2019;s life, but it takes a hero to face the biggest challenge of them all: Dominating your own world.<br>Turns out that all the villainous people throughout history aren&#x2019;t just evil or crazy; ultimately, they were all cowards. They didn&#x2019;t have the guts to take on the challenge of dominating their own world, so instead they focused on playing dirty so they could control others. But controlling others is nothing compared to the challenge of dominating your own life.<br>In fact, most people can&#x2019;t do it. They fold. They give up.

Of mixed blood Tsa-la-gi, GaWaNi Pony Boy was able to conceive his philosophy and compile the methods of relationship training while touring the United States with a Native American drum band and consulting the Tribal Elders from many different nations and backgrounds. The methods and beliefs of relationship training come directly from the first great horsemen of North America. Horse and rider are one. Theirs is a relationship of trust, harmony, and respect born of a way of life that is all but lost.&#x201d; The stunning full-color photographs by Gabrielle Boiselle capture Pony Boy&#x2019;s serenity and unity with his close horse companions. The author&#x2019;s simple eloquence forges a deep, profound relationship with his readers that few books ever hope to achieve. As Pony Boy writes in the introduction, For many [the Native American horseman] represents the ultimate rider. The essence of a horseman, both his skill and intuition, goes beyond the hours he spends in the saddle .the folklore of every Native tribe are stories, tales, and beliefs to exemplify human&#x2019;s relations to other animals.&#x201d; The book begins with an analysis of how horses came to live with the Natives of North America and horses&#x2019; impact on Native life. The crux of relationship training, according to the author, is to understand what it means to be a horse, react like a horse, and relate to other things like a horse .&#x201d; Native Americans were able to create such strong relationship with horses in a short time because they understood that a horse is a horse.&#x201d; Learning to balance the relationship between horse and human is the missing link to becoming a masterful horseman or horsewoman. The book describes not only the techniques involved for relationship training but also the belief system and attitude that must be applied to all methods of horsemanship.<br> <br>In addition to presenting the methods and philosophy of relationship training, Horse, Follow Closely also includes many stories and legends of Native Americans and their horses, all of which teach the reader something new about himself and his relationship with his horse.<br></p><p><p>GaWaNi Pony Boy has earned a name for himself in the horsemanship world. He and his 11-year-old equine partner, Kola, have traveled to schools, universities and equine events providing training clinics for the past 10 years.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Filthy Thirteen: From the Dustbowl to Hitler's Eagle&#x2019;s Nest - The True Story of "The Dirty Dozen"</h2><p>Since World War II, the American public has become fully aware of the exploits of the 101st Airborne Division, the paratroopers who led the Allied invasions into Nazi-held Europe. But within the ranks of the 101st, a sub-unit attained legendary status at the time, its reputation persisting among veterans over the decades. <br><br>Primarily products of the Dustbowl and the Depression, the Filthy13 grew notorious, even within the ranks of the elite 101st. Never ones to salute an officer, or take a bath, this squad became singular within the Screaming Eagles for its hard drinking, and savage fighting skill--and that was only in training. Just prior to the invasion of Normandy, a "Stars and Stripes" photographer caught U.S. paratroopers with heads shaved into Mohawks, applying war paint to their faces. Unknown to the American public at the time, these men were the Filthy 13. After parachuting behind enemy lines in the dark hours before D-Day, the Germans got a taste of the reckless courage of this unit - except now the men were fighting with Tommy guns and explosives, not just bare knuckles. In its spearhead role, the 13 suffered heavy casualties, some men wounded and others blown to bits. By the end of the war 30 men had passed through the squad. <br><br>Throughout the war, however, the heart and soul of the Filthy 13 remained a survivor named Jake McNiece, a half-breed Indian from Oklahoma - the toughest man in the squad and the one who formed its character. McNiece made four combat jumps, was in the forefront of every fight in northern Europe, yet somehow never made the rank of PFC. The survivors of the Filthy 13 stayed intact as a unit until the Allies finally conquered Nazi Germany. <br><br>The book does not draw a new portrait of earnest citizen soldiers. Instead it describes a group of hardscrabble guys whom any respectable person would be loath to meet in a bar or dark alley. But they were an integral part of the U.S. war against Nazi Germany. A brawling bunch of no-goodniks whose only saving grace was that they inflicted more damage on the Germans than on MPs, the English countryside and their own officers, the Filthy 13 remain a legend within the ranks of the 101st Airborne.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface<br>Introduction Jake McNiece<br><br>Chapter 1 Creating a Legend<br>Chapter 2 Fuel for the Myth<br>Chapter 3 A Bridge in Normandy<br>Chapter 4 Surviving Holland<br>Chapter 5 Rescue of a Division<br>Chapter 6 End of the War<br>Chapter 7 Get-Together<br>Epilogue The Moral of the Story<br><br>A Soldier&#x2019;s Prayer by Jack Agnew<br><br>Notes<br>Bibliography<br>Index<br></p><p>Richard E.

Looking closely at the recent conversations surrounding the so-called 'Benedict Option,' Carrie Gress uncovers something more fundamental to living a full, Christian life: the Marian Option. The call to personal holiness - given by Christ Himself - has no better exemplar over the centuries than our own Mother, Mary. St. Benedict would agree!

In <i>The Ravenmaster</i>, he lets us in on his life as he feeds his birds raw meat and biscuits soaked in blood, buys their food at Smithfield Market, and ensures that these unusual, misunderstood, and utterly brilliant corvids are healthy, happy, and ready to captivate the four million tourists who flock to the Tower every year. </p><p>A rewarding, intimate, and inspiring partnership has developed between the ravens and their charismatic and charming human, the Ravenmaster, who shares the folklore, history, and superstitions surrounding the ravens and the Tower. Shining a light on the behavior of the birds, their pecking order and social structure, and the tricks they play on us, Skaife shows who the Tower&#x2019;s true guardians really are&#x2015;and the result is a compelling and irreverent narrative that will surprise and enchant.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Skaife</b> is Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) and Ravenmaster at the Tower of London.

Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie&#x2014;a boy who has never known his father. Although both women live in the same Boston suburb, they are strangers to one another and have little in common, aside from a fierce love for their children. But one night, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge in ways no one could have imagined.</p> <p>This is the moving, luminous story of good people caught in untenable circumstances. Each being tested in ways they never thought possible. Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.</p></p><p>Emily Giffin is the author of several <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels, including <i>Something Borrowed,</i> which has been adapted as a major motion picture. A graduate of Wake Forest University and the University of Virginia School of Law, she lives in Atlanta with her family.<p>TESSA:</p><p>Whenever I hear of someone else&#x2019;s tragedy, I do not dwell on the accident or diagnosis, or even the initial shockwaves or aftermath of grief. Instead, I find myself reconstructing those final, ordinary moments. Moments that make up our lives. Moments that were blissfully taken for granted&#x2014;and that likely would have been forgotten altogether but for what followed. The <em>before </em>snapshots. </p><p>I can so clearly envision the thirty-four-year-old woman in the shower one Saturday evening, reaching for her favorite apricot body scrub, contemplating what to wear to the party, hopeful that the cute guy from the coffee shop will make an appearance, when she suddenly happens upon the unmistakable lump in her left breast. </p><p>Or the devoted, young father, driving his daughter to buy her first-day-of-school Mary Janes, cranking up <em>Here Comes the Sun</em> on the radio, reminding her for the umpteenth time that the Beatles are &#x201c;without a doubt the greatest band of all time,&#x201d; as the teenaged boy, bleary-eyed from too many late-night Budweisers, runs the red light. </p><p>Or the brash high-school receiver, full of promise and pride, out on the sweltering practice field the day before the big football game, winking at his girlfriend from her usual post at the chain-link fence, just before leaping into the air to make the catch nobody else could have made&#x2014;and then twisting, falling headfirst on that sickening, fluke angle. </p><p>I think about the thin, fragile line separating all of us from misfortune, almost as a way of putting a few coins in my own gratitude meter, of safeguarding against an <em>after</em> happening to me. To <em>us</em>. Ruby and Frank, Nick and me. Our foursome&#x2014;the source of both my greatest joys and most consuming worries. </p><p>And so, when my husband&#x2019;s pager goes off while we are at dinner, I do not allow myself to feel resentment or even disappointment. I tell myself that this is only one meal, one night, even though it is our anniversary and the first proper date Nick and I have had in nearly a month, maybe two. I have nothing to be upset about, not compared to what someone else is enduring at this very instant. This will not be the hour I will have to rewind forever. I am still among the lucky ones. </p><p>&#x201c;Shit. I&#x2019;m sorry, Tess,&#x201d; Nick says, silencing his pager with his thumb, then running his hand through his dark hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back.&#x201d; </p><p>I nod my understanding and watch my husband stride with sexy, confident purpose toward the front of the restaurant where he will make the necessary call. I can tell, just by the sight of his straight back and broad shoulders navigating deftly around the tables, that he is steeling himself for the bad news, preparing to fix someone, save someone. It is when he is at his best. It is why I fell in love with him in the first place, seven years and two children ago. </p><p>Nick disappears around the corner as I draw a deep breath and take in my surroundings, noticing details of the room for the first time. The celadon abstract painting above the fireplace. The soft flicker of candlelight. The enthusiastic laughter at the table next to ours as a silver-haired man holds court with what appears to be his wife and four grown children. The richness of the cabernet I am drinking alone. </p><p>Minutes later, Nick returns with a grimace and says he&#x2019;s sorry for the second, but certainly not the last, time. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I say, glancing around for our waiter. </p><p>&#x201c;I found him,&#x201d; Nick says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s bringing our dinner to-go.&#x201d; </p><p>I reach across the table for his hand and gently squeeze it. He squeezes mine back, and as we wait for our filets to arrive in Styrofoam, I consider asking what happened as I almost always do. Instead, I simply say a quick, simple prayer for the people I don&#x2019;t know and then one for my own children, tucked safely into their beds. </p><p>I picture Ruby, softly snoring, all twisted in her sheets, wild even in her sleep. Ruby, our precocious, fearless firstborn, four going on fourteen, with her bewitching smile, dark curls that she makes even tighter in her self-portraits, too young to know that as a girl she is supposed to want what she does <em>not</em> have, and those pale aquamarine eyes, a genetic feat for her brown-eyed parents. She has ruled our home and hearts since virtually the day she was born&#x2014;in a way that both exhausts me and fills me with admiration. She is exactly like her father&#x2014;stubborn, passionate, breathtakingly beautiful. A daddy&#x2019;s girl to the core. </p><p>And then there&#x2019;s Frank, our satisfying baby boy with a cuteness and sweetness that exceeds the mere garden-variety-baby cute and sweet, so much so that strangers in the grocery store will stop and remark. He is nearly two, but still loves to cuddle, nestling his smooth round cheek against my neck, fiercely devoted to his mama. <em>He&#x2019;s not my favorite</em>, I swear to Nick in private, when he smiles and accuses me of this parental transgression. I do not have a favorite, unless perhaps it is Nick himself. It is a different kind of love, of course. The love for my children is without condition or end, and I would most certainly save them over Nick, if say, all three were bitten by rattlesnakes on a camping trip and I only had two anti-venom shots in my backpack. And yet, there is nobody I&#x2019;d rather talk to, be near, look at, than my husband, an unprecedented feeling that overcame me the moment we met. </p><p>Our dinner and check arrive moments later, and Nick and I stand and walk out of the restaurant into the star-filled, purple night. It is early October, but feels more like winter than fall&#x2014;cold even by Boston standards&#x2014;and I shiver beneath my long cashmere coat as Nick hands the valet our ticket and we get into our car. We leave the city and drive back to Wellesley with little conversation, listening to one of Nick&#x2019;s many jazz CDs. </p><p>Thirty minutes later, we are pulling up our long, tree-lined driveway. &#x201c;How late do you think you&#x2019;ll be?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hard to say,&#x201d; Nick says, putting the car into park and leaning across the front seat to kiss my cheek. I turn my face toward him and our lips softly meet. </p><p>&#x201c;Happy anniversary,&#x201d; he whispers. </p><p>&#x201c;Happy anniversary,&#x201d; I say. </p><p>He pulls away, and our eyes lock as he says, &#x201c;To be continued?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always,&#x201d; I say, forcing a smile and slipping out of the car. </p><p>Before I can close the door, Nick cranks up the volume of his music, dramatically punctuating the end of one evening, the start of another. As I let myself in the house, Vince Guaraldi&#x2019;s <em>Lullaby of the Leaves</em> echoes in my head where it remains long after I&#x2019;ve paid the babysitter, checked on the kids, changed out of my backless black dress and eaten cold steak at the kitchen counter. </p><p>Much later, having turned down Nick&#x2019;s side of the bed and crawled into my own, I am alone in the dark, thinking of the call in the restaurant. I close my eyes, wondering whether we are ever truly blindsided by misfortune. Or, somehow, somewhere, in the form of empathy or worry or a premonition deep within ourselves, do we feel it coming? </p><p>I fall asleep, not knowing the answer. Not knowing that this will be the night I will return to, after all.</p></p><h2>Coming of Age Around the World: A Multicultural Anthology</h2><p><p>Following in the footsteps of the highly successful <i>Coming of Age in America</i>, this collection of twenty-four stories from around the world is a wonderful introduction to literature rarely available to American readers. Editors Faith Adiele and Mary Frosch magnificently chart the global quest for identity, and make a strong case for the personal and political importance of sharing our stories as they consider whether coming of age is a Western&#x2014;or universal&#x2014;concept.</p> <p>Featuring an array of voices from every continent, this anthology includes luminaries like Ben Okri and Chang-rae Lee, as well as recent bestsellers Marjane Satrapi and Alexandra Fuller, in addition to a variety of authors renowned abroad but less well known to North American audiences. The diversity extends to form, encompassing fiction and memoir, graphics, lyric prose, and tales in pidgin and patois.</p> <p>The world presented is complex and current, some inhabitants routinely switching country and language, others trapped by global events that shape us all. Detailed introductions provide historical and cultural context, particularly for Africa and the Muslim world.</p> <br></p><p>Faith Adiele received the PEN Beyond Margins Award for her memoir about coming of age in Thailand, <i>Meeting Faith: The Forest Journals of a Black Buddhist Nun</i> (W.W.

In <i>Imagining Abundance</i>, Kerry Robinson focuses on reasons why each of us are called to be stewards. We act because we&#x2019;re excited about what it is that we do for the church and where we&#x2019;re called by God to be, we want others to be just as excited about what that is, and we want people to be partners with us in that ministry.In <i>Imagining Abundance</i>, Kerry Robinson offers an inspirational and practical guide to effective fundraising that is ideal for anyone invested in a faith community. Bishops, provincials, pastors, ministers, executive and development directors and trustees of faith-based organizations will benefit from this healthy approach to the activity of fundraising that situates successful development in the context of ministry and mission.</p><p>Kerry Alys Robinson is the executive director of the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, which is dedicated to promoting excellence and best practices in the management, finances, and human resource development of the Catholic Church in the United States. She is a frequent writer and speaker on the subjects of philanthropy, development and faith and is author of a blog on spirituality called <i>Love in Ordinary Time</i>.&nbsp;<br>Kerry Alys Robinson is one of the great women in the Catholic church today. Her new book is an indispensable tool for all fundraisers and philanthropists, as well as all charitable organizations, who seek to help those in need. She brings a wealth of experience, a probing mind and a deep respect for the life of the spirit to her amazing work, and now to her beautiful book. Highly recommended.<br> James Martin, SJ, author of <i>Jesus: A Pilgrimage</i><br><br>In <i>Imagining Abundance</i> Kerry Robinson invites us to accompany her on a holy journey as she takes us on a personalized journey through her life as a philanthropist and fundraiser. The result is an insightful book that is a must read for donors and fundraisers who want to explore the ways in which faith and spiritual values can inspire and inform transformative and thoughtful giving.<br> William G. Enright,Senior Fellow &amp; Founding Director, The Lake Institute on Faith &amp; Giving, Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, Indiana University<br><br>This is an essential and instructive book-and at the same time, it is also deeply spiritual and inspiring. It will speak profoundly to anyone interested in the deeper call of vocation, and in achieving great impact for God's people and the common good. Kerry Robinson speaks from firsthand experience and keen understanding of the two interrelated worlds of philanthropy and fundraising."<br> Alexia Kelley, President and CEO, Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities (FADICA)<br><br><i>Imagining Abundance</i> is a spectacular achievement. I'm not surprised-no one is more capable of writing it than Kerry Robinson. She has so well integrated faith and philanthropy throughout her own life. She reminds that "to whom much is given, much is expected" (Luke 12:48). It will be an inspiration to all of us to be good stewards of what God has given-so abundantly.<br> Thomas Groome, Professor of Theology and Religious Education, Boston College, Author of <i>What Makes us Catholic</i><br><br>In a voice that radiates joy from every page, Kerry Robinson shows us that there is grace to be had on both sides of the asking/giving coin, that "other-centeredness" can truly be a vocation, and that we needn't worry about always slicing the pie more thinly. We have the ingredients to make vastly larger, more nutritious ones. This book, <i>Imagining Abundance,</i> makes me proud to be in the fundraising business!<br> Craig J. Leach, CEO, Graham-Pelton Consulting, Inc./Collegium, Inc.<br><br>Not since Henri Nouwen's little book on the spirituality of fundraising have we been given a jewel like this book. Kerry Robinson weaves her own story-which includes her deep roots in the Raskob family's remarkable philanthropic spirit-together with priceless practical theological wisdom and marvelous examples of everyday people serving God and the church. By doing so with such candor and grace, Robinson helps us glimpse the Holy Spirit at work in our midst when we re-imagine philanthropy and fundraising as signs of the abundance that flow from the generosity of God.<br> John Wimmer, Program Director, Religion, Lilly Endowment<br><br><i>Imagining Abundance</i> is an autobiographical case study of one of the most impressive campaigns in history to build a vibrant Catholic campus ministry center at a major research university. Kerry Robinson knows development both as a member of a philanthropic foundation and as a chief development officer. Her account provides more than principles for effective fundraising; it provides a spirituality of development work. This is a must read for all involved in faith-based development.<br> Gregory E. Sterling, The Reverend Henry L. Slack Dean, The Lillian Claus Professor of New Testament Yale Divinity School<br><br>Pope Francis tells us that there is only one mission and it is Jesus' mission. Kerry calls us to live that mission with great hope, enthusiasm, and joy in abundance. Everyone involved in development should read Imagining Abundance. It would be a perfect gift to share with a board of directors or trustees. It is well worth the read, but more importantly worth the conversations and ideas it will inspire.<br> Sr. Georgette Lehmuth, OSF, President and CEO, National Catholic Development Conference</p><h2>Nightblind: A Thriller (The Dark Iceland Series, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Chilling and complex,<i> Nightblind </i>is an extraordinary thriller from Ragnar Jonasson, an undeniable new talent.</b></p><p>Ari Thor Arason is a local policeman who has an uneasy relationship with the villagers in an idyllically quiet fishing village in Northern Iceland&#x2015;where no one locks their doors.</p><p>The peace of this close-knit community is shattered by a murder.

He lived the life of a sailor, actor, stand-up comedian, radio host, bobby, even a bus driver. He was the recipient of an honorary doctorate in literature from the University of Liverpool and a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of more than twenty-five books for younger readers, including the wildly popular Redwall series. Dr. Jacques was a lifelong resident of Liverpool, England.<b>Chapter 2</b><br>In the woodlands south of Redwall Abbey, other young creatures were abroad that day: a small gang of water rats, eight in all, headed by one Groffgut. Leaving the larger vermin bands, they had wandered up country, seeking any opportunity to plunder, kill or cause terror. This was done in the hope of establishing themselves as a feared vermin band. Thus far they had made patchy progress, but Groffgut&#x2019;s confidence was growing daily.<br><br>Warm noontide sun slanted through the trees onto a quiet streambank. Some of the rats lay about by the shallows, fishing the limpid waters, whilst others foraged for nests with eggs in. Groffgut disdained such menial tasks, letting the others do all the chores. By virtue of his size, strength and quick temper, he was the chief. Stretched flat out, he gazed over the bump of his paunchy gut, idly watching the blue-grey campfire smoke blending amid sun shafts. <br><br>One of his minions, Hangpaw, limped up from the shallows, displaying a small perch dangling from a line. &#x201c;Yeherr, Chief, lookit, I gorra fish!&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut was not impressed. &#x201c;Yarr, s&#x2019;only a likkle &#x2019;un. Stick it onna fire, an&#x2019; go an&#x2019; catcher some big &#x2019;uns.&#x201d; <br><br>An excited whoop rang out from farther up the bank. &#x201c;Yaggoo! Cumm an&#x2019; see dis, mates, I gorra h&#x2019;eagle!&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut heaved his bulk up irately. &#x201c;Wot&#x2019;s dat Frogeye shoutin&#x2019; about now?&#x201d; Plugtail, another of the gang, came scurrying up. &#x201c;Chief, Chief, Frogeye&#x2019;s catchered a h&#x2019;eagle!&#x201d;<br><br>Groffgut shoved him to one side. The rest followed him as he went to investigate, grumbling all the way. &#x201c;Huh, shupid! Rats don&#x2019;t catcher h&#x2019;eagles, don&#x2019;t dat ijjit know? It&#x2019;s h&#x2019;eagles wot catchers rats!&#x201d; <br><br>None of the gang had ever seen an eagle before, but there was no doubt that Frogeye had captured a big, fierce bird. It looked a lot like they imagined an eagle should look. Frogeye&#x2019;s lazy eye, the one that normally remained lidded over, was blinking up and down, exposing the milky-hued pupil, as the rat danced around, prodding and tripping his find with a crude, homemade spear. The wounded and exhausted bird stumbled forward, desperately trying to get at the life-sustaining streamwater. <br><br>Frogeye slammed his spearbutt into its body, toppling it backward, tail over crest. He laughed callously. &#x201c;Yeeheehe! See, I told ya, didden&#x2019;t I? I catched a real live h&#x2019;eagle all by meself!&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut drew his sword, which was in reality a broken scythe blade with a rope handle. Approaching the big bird, he stood on one of its half-spread wings, pinning the other with his blade as he inspected it. Had the bird not been injured or fatigued, any rat would have rushed for cover at the sight of it. Groffgut saw clearly that it was unable to resist. The bird&#x2019;s savage golden eyes were clouded and flickering shut, a stream of dried blood apparently having sealed its lethally hooked beak. The magnificent dark brown and white plumage stuck out willy-nilly after being battered for leagues across stormbound seas. <br><br>Groffgut gave the gang his verdict. &#x201c;Aye, it&#x2019;s a h&#x2019;eagle, shore enuff!&#x201d; <br><br>Nobeast took the trouble to argue, though Hangpaw, a thin rat with a withered limb, ventured to enquire, &#x201c;Wot&#x2019;s we s&#x2019;posed ter do wid h&#x2019;eagles?&#x201d; Threetooth, who lacked all but three fangs, cackled. &#x201c;Yer eats &#x2019;em, I think.&#x201d;His companion, Rashback, so named because of an unsightly mange, scratched vigourously at his scraggy tail. &#x201c;I didden know ye could eat h&#x2019;eagles!&#x201d;Groffgut eyed him contemptuously. &#x201c;Ye can eat anybeast once it&#x2019;s dead, turnep&#x2019;ead!&#x201d;Frogeye became huffy at not being consulted. &#x201c;Hoi! Dis is my h&#x2019;eagle, I catchered it. S&#x2019;pose I duzzen&#x2019;t wanner eat it, eh?&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut pointed at Frogeye with his sword. &#x201c;Tern around willyer, mate.&#x201d;Frogeye turned obediently, and Groffgut dealt him an enormous kick to the bottom, which knocked him flat. The breath whooshed out of Frogeye as Groffgut stamped a footpaw down on his back, sneering, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the chief round &#x2019;ere! Who asked yew, malletnose? Plug, git yore rope round dis h&#x2019;eagle&#x2019;s claws, lash &#x2019;im tight.&#x201d;Plugtail flung his rope around the big bird&#x2019;s legs and noosed them securely. The bird could only flap its wings feebly in protest. <br><br>Groffgut issued his orders to the gang. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll eat the h&#x2019;eagle later. Let&#x2019;s &#x2019;ave a bit o&#x2019; fun wid it first. T&#x2019;ain&#x2019;t every day yer gits a h&#x2019;eagle ter play wid. Tow it back ter camp, mates!&#x201d; <br><br>The wood-gathering expedition had been a success. Tiria and her three friends had worked diligently, filling the cart with a selection of long branches and straight, thick limbs. It was mainly good yew staves, some pieces of ash and a selection of lesser but useful bits of willow and birch. The four companions were following the course of a stream, which they knew flowed close to the south path at one point. Once they reached the path, Redwall would be within easy walking distance. Tiria estimated they would reach the Abbey by early evening. <br><br>Enjoying the freedom of the outdoors, and being in no great hurry, they opted to take a break for an afternoon snack on the streambank. Girry unpacked the last of their food, whilst Tiria checked the ropes which bound the cargo of wood to the cart. Brinty and Tribsy skimmed flat pebbles over the slow-flowing stream. The ottermaid felt quietly proud of herself; she had completed her task without any untoward incident. Cooling her footpaws in the shallows, she watched the noon shadows start to lengthen over the tranquil waters. Two green- and black-banded dragonflies patrolled the far reed margin, their wings iridescent in the sunlight. Bees droned drowsily around some water crowfoot blossoms, and birdsong echoed amid the trees. <br><br>Tribsy left off skimming and sat down to eat. &#x201c;Froo&#x2019; corjul an&#x2019; hunny sangwiches, moi fayverrit!&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria smiled. &#x201c;Good old Friar Bibble, he knows how to look after hungry workers, eh Tribsy?&#x201d; <br><br>The young mole smiled from ear to ear. &#x201c;Hurr, an&#x2019; us&#x2019;ll be back at ee Red&#x2019;all in gudd toime furr supper. Oi dearly loikes a noice supper, so oi doo&#x2019;s!&#x201d; <br><br>Brinty took a long swig of the fruit cordial. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever think of anything but eating, old famine face?&#x201d; <br><br>Tribsy patted his stomach. &#x201c;Whut&#x2019;s to think abowt, maister? Oi bee&#x2019;s nought but ee pore choild needin&#x2019; vittles aplenty to grow.&#x201d; <br><br>Brinty watched the young mole demolish a sandwich in two bites. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re growing sideways instead of upwards.&#x201d; <br><br>Girry gestured his friends to be quiet as his ears stood up straight. &#x201c;Ssshh! Listen, did you hear that?&#x201d; <br><br>They listened for a moment, then Tiria shrugged. &#x201c;Hear what?&#x201d;<br><br>Girry pointed upstream. &#x201c;Over that way, sounded like somebeasts enjoying themselves, laughing and shouting.&#x201d; <br><br>Tribsy wrinkled his snout. &#x201c;Oi doan&#x2019;t yurrs nuthin&#x2019;. You&#x2019;m squirrels can yurr better&#x2019;n uz moles, burr aye.&#x201d; <br><br>Brinty shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t hear anything, either.&#x201d; <br><br>Girry began climbing a nearby elm. &#x201c;Well, I can hear it, there&#x2019;s something going on up yonder. You three stay here, I&#x2019;ll go and take a peep.&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria cautioned her friend, &#x201c;Stay in the treetops, Girry. Don&#x2019;t go getting yourself into any trouble. I don&#x2019;t want to face my dad back at the Abbey and have to tell him something happened to you!&#x201d; <br><br>The agile young squirrel threw her a curt salute. &#x201c;Yes marm, don&#x2019;t fret marm, I&#x2019;ll be fine marm!&#x201d; <br><br>The ottermaid watched him ascend into the upper foliage. &#x201c;Well, just be careful, and less of the marm, please! I&#x2019;m only one season older than you, cheekybrush!&#x201d;Tribsy commandeered another sandwich. &#x201c;Oi&#x2019;ll just finish off ee vittles whoile us&#x2019;ns bee&#x2019;s waitin&#x2019;. Ho joy, this &#x2019;un&#x2019;s gotten cheese on it, moi fayverite!&#x201d;Brinty looked at his molefriend in amazement. &#x201c;Is there any sandwich that isn&#x2019;t your favourite?&#x201d; <br><br>Tribsy shook his head solemnly. &#x201c;Oi b&#x2019;aint found one as yet, zurr.&#x201d; <br><br>After a while they went back to skimming stones. Tiria was by far the best skimmer, making one flat chip of bankrock jump nine times as it bounced over the water. It was rather pleasant passing an afternoon in this fashion, the ottermaid thought. She began to wonder what the fuss and stern warnings from her father had been all about.Just then, Girry dropped down out of the elm in a rush of leaves and twig ends. The young squirrel, breathless with indignation and urgency, gabbled out, &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got a big bird hanging upside down from a tree and they&#x2019;re lighting a fire under it, hitting it with spearpoles. We&#x2019;ve got to stop them, Tiria, oh, the poor bird!&#x201d; <br><br>Grabbing her friend, the ottermaid shook him soundly. &#x201c;Make sense, Girry! What big bird, where, and who&#x2019;s hitting it? Now take a deep breath and start again, properly!&#x201d;Girry obeyed, taking several breaths before he recovered. &#x201c;I went upstream. I was up in a beech when I saw them. There&#x2019;s about eight water rats, nasty-looking scum. Anyhow, these rats, they&#x2019;ve got a big bird strung upside down from a bough, and they&#x2019;re torturing it to death, I swear they are. Please, Tiria, we must do something to help the bird!&#x201d;Unwinding the sling Wuppit from about her waist, Tiria took charge swiftly.&#x201c;Take an axe, Girry. Go on ahead of us and get close to the bird without being seen. Then wait for us. Tribsy, Brinty, take two good yew staves from the cart and follow behind me!&#x201d;Plugtail and Hangpaw were trying to set light to a heap of twigs, leaves and moss beneath where the big bird was hanging upside down. They had to keep ducking as the other gang rats swung the hawk back and forth by prodding and striking at it with their spears. The bird&#x2019;s wings hung limply outspread. Though it hissed feebly at its tormentors, there was no way it could stop them. <br><br>Groffgut was enjoying himself immensely at the expense of his helpless victim. He swung his crude sword at the bird, clipping a few of its throat feathers, while taunting it cruelly. &#x201c;Once dat fire&#x2019;s ablaze, we&#x2019;ll roast yer nice&#x2019;n&#x2019;slow, birdy. May&#x2019;ap it&#x2019;ll be suppertime afore yore dead an&#x2019; ready, eh?&#x201d; <br><br>Frogeye took a lunge at the bird with his spear but missed. &#x201c;Kin I &#x2019;ave one of its legs, Chief? It was me wot catchered it.&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut snarled and aimed a kick at him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll &#x2019;ave one of yore legs if&#x2019;n ye slays that h&#x2019;eagle too quick. Stop stabbin&#x2019; at it like that, snottynose!&#x201d; <br><br>Parraaaang! A hard river pebble shot out of the trees, striking the swordblade and knocking it from Groffgut&#x2019;s grasp. He went immediately into an agonised dance, sucking at the paw which was stinging from the reverberation of the strike. <br><br> &#x201c;Yeeeeek! Who did that? Heeeyaaagh!&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria sped onto the streambank, whirling another stone in her sling as she shouted, &#x201c;Get away from that bird, rat!&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut stopped dancing, tears beading in his squinched eyes. He saw that it was a lone otter. Waving his numbed paw at the gang, he screeched, &#x201c;Kill dat riverdog t&#x2019;bits. Slay &#x2019;er!&#x201d; <br><br>Frogeye leaped forward, thrusting with his spear. Tiria sidestepped it. Swinging the stone-loaded sling, she brought it crashing into the rat&#x2019;s jaw as she roared, &#x201c;Redwaaaaallll!&#x201d; <br><br>Brinty and Tribsy charged out of the bushes, laying about heftily with their long staves. Girry dropped down onto the bough which held the big bird. Leaping from there to the ground, he scattered the smouldering fire with his axe. Tribsy gave Plugtail a crack across both legs with his staff, which sent the rat hurtling into the stream. Brinty brought the butt of his staff straight into Groffgut&#x2019;s belly as he reached with his good paw for the sword. Then he began lambasting the gang chief mercilessly. Tiria was everywhere at once, flailing with her loaded sling, cracking the rats&#x2019; paws, ribs, tails and heads. Whilst all this was going on, Girry placed his back beneath the bird&#x2019;s head and supported it.Taken aback by the ambush, most of the rats fled for their lives, leaving only three of their number at the scene. Threetooth and Frogeye were stretched out senseless; Groffgut, unfortunately, was still conscious, wailing and pleading as Brinty whacked on at him in a frenzy, yelling at him with each blow he delivered. &#x201c;Dirty! Filthy! Torturer!&#x201d;Tiria seized the young mouse, lifting him clear of his target. &#x201c;Enough, he&#x2019;s had enough! Do you want to kill him?&#x201d; <br><br>Brinty was still waving his staff at empty air, roaring, &#x201c;Aye, I&#x2019;ll kill the scum sure enough. Rotten, murdering torturer. He&#x2019;s not fit to stay alive!&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria squeezed Brinty hard. &#x201c;Now stop that, this instant!&#x201d; <br><br>The young mouse suddenly calmed down. He dropped his staff at the realisation of the wild way he had been behaving. &#x201c;Sorry, mate, I must have got carried away!&#x201d;Tribsy chuckled. &#x201c;Hurr, you&#x2019;m surrpintly did, zurr, boi okey, Miz Tiria. Coom on, let&#x2019;s get ee pore burd daown!&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria relieved Girry by holding the weight of the limp hawk. The young squirrel took his axe, clambered up into the tree and cut the rope with a single stroke. <br><br>The ottermaid lowered the bird gently to the ground, murmuring softly to it, even though it was unconscious. &#x201c;There there, easy now. You&#x2019;re among friends. We&#x2019;ll get you back to Redwall Abbey. You&#x2019;ll be taken care of there, I promise.&#x201d; <br><br>Girry bounded out of the tree, calling to Tribsy, &#x201c;Come on, we&#x2019;ll get the cart to carry the big bird on.&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria stayed by the hawk&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;Good idea, mates. Brinty, you keep an eye on that rat, he looks like their leader.&#x201d; <br><br>The young mouse strode over to Groffgut, issuing a harsh warning. &#x201c;One move out of you, lardbelly, and I&#x2019;ll break your skull!&#x201d; Then he picked up Groffgut&#x2019;s sword and flung it into the stream as the rat gang chief lay there helplessly, glaring hatred at Brinty through his swollen eyes.When they returned with the cart, it took three of them to lift the big bird on. It lay limp atop the wood cargo. <br><br>Tribsy stroked its head. &#x201c;Do ee bee&#x2019;s still naow, burd. We&#x2019;m friends, acumm to &#x2019;elp ee.&#x201d;The bird&#x2019;s golden eyes opened for a brief moment before it passed out again. Tribsy patted it gently. &#x201c;Thurr naow, ee pore creetur, you&#x2019;m sleep well. Us&#x2019;ll watch o&#x2019;er ee &#x2019;til you&#x2019;m gets to ee h&#x2019;Abbey!&#x201d; <br><br>Tiria settled the bird more comfortably on the cart and went to Brinty. The young mouse was wielding his staff, standing guard over Groffgut. The ottermaid nodded approvingly. &#x201c;Well done, mate. I think you knocked all the fight out of that one!&#x201d;She turned the rat over with her footpaw. &#x201c;Listen carefully, vermin. We&#x2019;re not murderers like you, that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re still alive. But I warn you, stay out of Mossflower, or you won&#x2019;t get off so lightly next time.&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut made as if to snarl, but Brinty jabbed him sharply. &#x201c;Listen, scumface. If you ever cross my path again, I&#x2019;ll break your skull. Do I make myself clear?&#x201d;The gang leader never answered. He lay there, his whole body one throbbing pulse of pain from the beating Brinty had given him. Then he spat contemptuously, still glaring at the young mouse. Brinty took a step forward, but Tiria pulled him away.&#x201c;Come on, leave him. We&#x2019;ve got to get the poor bird back to Redwall. I think that vermin&#x2019;s learned his lesson.&#x201d; <br><br>Groffgut watched them go. When they were safely out of earshot, he stared balefully at Brinty&#x2019;s back, muttering, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ferget you, mousey, oh no! Next time we meet will be yer dyin&#x2019; day. But I&#x2019;ll make it nice&#x2019;n&#x2019;slow for ye!&#x201d; <br><br>As the friends made their way along the streambank, Tiria noticed that Brinty&#x2019;s paws were shaking and his jaw was trembling. &#x201c;Are you alright, mate?&#x201d; she murmured.The young mouse shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never raised my paw in anger against another creature before, and I&#x2019;ve never been in a fight. I don&#x2019;t know what happened to me back there. That rat was much bigger than me. If he could have reached his sword, he&#x2019;d have slain me easily. You know me, Tiria, I&#x2019;m usually the most peaceful of mice. But when I thought of the way that rat had treated the bird, well, I just lost control. I&#x2019;m sorry...</p><h2>Advanced Tarot Secrets (Aphrodite&#39;s Book of Secrets)</h2><p><b>Here&#x2019;s how to get 3 to 5 times more information from each spread you cast right now:</b> <p> Ask better questions, do all of your pre-spreadwork, and verify the accuracy of your spread before you start making any predictions. <i>Advanced Tarot Secrets</i> illustrates, step-by-step, how to do all of this.

These simulate the exact methods you use in &#x201c;real life&#x201d; readings, and make you infinitely more comfortable reading for other people. Next we introduce you to 6 new games that teach you how to see the various layers of meaning each card offers, and how cards interact in a spread. These games help you understand how the Tarot reflects the intricacies of daily life: In a simple ten-card spread you can see more details than three other people reading the same spread. </p><p> Next come <i>advanced spread basics</i> and <i>advanced spread techniques</i>. Here you apply everything you learn in the exercises and games: </p><ol> <li>Quick and easy ways to clear your deck between clients (useful at parties or working psychic fairs and hotlines) </li><li>Why every spread needs a protagonist </li><li>How to instantly verify the accuracy of your spread (no more bad readings&#x2014;<i>ever</i>) </li><li>How to modify your favorite spread to meet your needs for each reading </li><li>Hidden spreads, spread patterns and themes, the four passes through a spread every reading should have </li><li>When to use clarification or expansion cards, how to read cards face down&#x2014;and why </li><li>How to give accurate &#x201c;no-spread readings&#x201d; </li><li>And several other advanced techniques </li></ol> Once you understand all of these things, you can dowse with the Tarot, work on archaeological expeditions, work for treasure hunters, work with stock analysts to predict economic trends, remote view (we don&#x2019;t call it &#x201c;spying&#x201d;), solve any problem, design your own spreads and decks, and charge a LOT more for your services. <i>Advanced Tarot Secrets</i> is not &#x201c;yet another book on the Tarot,&#x201d; it is a Tarot revolution. This book frees you from the limitations of old worn-out techniques that create no real value in people&#x2019;s lives.</p><p>I have been studying the Tarot for over 35 years and been teaching it professionally for over 20. This book is the distilled wisdom I have collected from over three decades of study and practice, reading books, reading clients, experiments, and the close association of hundreds of some of the world's best psychics, astrologers, and Tarot readers, every day, for years on end. I had the privilege of working with extremely talented individuals in groups and individually, in the same office, and we shared our experiences and best techniques. What you will learn in this book can be found nowhere else in the world.&nbsp;<br>You will NOT find speculation, dogma, artificial systems, or any other worthless techniques that don't make you a better reader anyway. Everything in this book has been tested, proven, and several of these techniques have been passed down through the generations. But please understand that there is no substitute for sincere effort. There is no book in the world that can make you a Tarot master in ten minutes. If you see any book or course that promises you such, run. It is a blatant scam. The techniques in this book have allowed students of mine to manifest innumerable physical tangible items. We have conjured up all kinds of great things, but these are our experiences. We studied. We practiced these techniques and put in the efforts to get results. I won't be there to hold your hand and make sure that you will actually do the required work, or that you will take your studies seriously. I can't guarantee you results. I can't guarantee that you will even buy this book and read it. Your life is your own. I wrote this book because these techniques have changed countless lives for the better. I wanted to make sure that they did not vanish in time.&nbsp;<b> What exactly are the secrets that separate the MASTER from the apprentice?</b>&nbsp;<br>What is it that separates the best readers in the world from everyone else? <i>It is&nbsp;</i><i>the clarity, depth, and precision of the information they give to their clients.&nbsp;</i>They use the same 78-card decks everyone else does, but they pull layers upon layers of additional meaning from their cards. Their level of detail stuns new clients. <i>You can do this too.</i><i>&nbsp;</i><b>There is no magic keyword or phrase you have to memorize to understand&nbsp;</b><b>the Tarot at a professional level.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no numerological or Kabbalistic formula that will make you an instant master. To get the results of a Tarot master, you have to learn the techniques of a Tarot master. You are about to learn them here. Hidden in each spread you cast are mini-spreads, patterns, and themes. Your job is to learn to spot these. These extra details reveal how all of the cards interact with each other in your reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that the spread you cast is a neighborhood filled with people with all different personality types. One family's children plays with another, while the grumpy old man chases them off of his lawn. The teenagers down the street have loud parties at night that some neighbors mind, while others do not. It is this subtle interplay of the cards in every spread you cast that paints richer, deeper, and more textured scenes. This additional information--gleaned from the card interaction in your spreads--stimulates your intuition, and works with your logic, to create a "Total Mind Awareness," which fills you with a greater understanding of the overall picture, as well as all of the individual components. &nbsp;Now you can give your clients far more exact and accurate information. This level of skill is essential for corporate-level work.</p><h2>Policing the Black Man: Arrest, Prosecution, and Imprisonment</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive, readable analysis of the key issues of the Black Lives Matter movement, this thought-provoking and compelling anthology features essays by some of the nation&#x2019;s most influential and respected criminal justice experts and legal scholars.</b><br><br><i>Policing the Black Man</i> explores and critiques the many ways the criminal justice system impacts the lives of African American boys and men at every stage of the criminal process, from arrest through sentencing.&nbsp; Essays range from an explication of the historical roots of racism in the criminal justice system to an examination of modern-day police killings of unarmed black men. The contributors discuss and explain racial profiling, the power and discretion of police and prosecutors, the role of implicit bias, the racial impact of police and prosecutorial decisions, the disproportionate imprisonment of black men, the collateral consequences of mass incarceration, and the Supreme Court&#x2019;s failure to provide meaningful remedies for the injustices in the criminal justice system. <i>Policing the Black Man</i> is an enlightening must-read for anyone interested in the critical issues of race and justice in America.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>ANGELA J. DAVIS</b>&nbsp;is a professor of law at the American University and a former director of the D.C. Public Defender Service. She is the author of <i>Arbitrary Justice: The Power of the American Prosecutor </i>and the coeditor of several books on criminal law and procedure. She has also written many articles and contributed chapters to many books on prosecutorial power and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.<b>Introduction</b><br>ANGELA J. DAVIS<br>&nbsp;<br>Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Fred�die Gray, Sam DuBose, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, and Terence Crutcher are just some of the names on a long list of unarmed black boys and men who were killed by police officers in recent years. Although black men have been the victims of violence at the hands of the state since the time of slavery, tech�nology and social media now permit us to literally bear witness to many of these killings, repeatedly. Millions of people have watched the video of a police officer choking Eric Garner to death as he struggled for air. Similarly, millions have watched the video of a police officer shooting Walter Scott in the back as he ran for his life. Who can ever forget the grainy footage of Tamir Rice&#x2014;the twelve-year-old boy who was shot by a police officer while he played alone with a toy gun in a park near his home? Two videos&#x2014;one from a police helicopter and another from a police dashboard camera&#x2014;show Terence Crutcher walk�ing away from police officers with his hands raised high in the air just before he was shot and killed. These images have evoked feelings of fear, sadness, and outrage and serve as a reminder that the lives of black men and boys continue to be devalued and destroyed with impunity at the hands of the state. To date, not one of the police officers who killed these men and boys has been convicted of a single crime.<br>&nbsp;<br>From the arrival of the first slaves in Jamestown in 1619 to the lynchings of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present day&#x2014;black boys and men have been unlawfully killed by those who were sworn to uphold the law and by vigilantes who took the law into their own hands. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened its doors on September 24, 2016, includes exhibits that tell the story of many of these killings. Yet these killings are not just a part of African American history. They have continued well into the twenty-first century&#x2014;almost four hundred years after the beginning of slavery&#x2014;and persist with remarkable fre�quency and brutality during a time when America elected its first African American president.<br>&nbsp;<br>Many of these race-based killings have inspired and reinvig�orated movements for change. The brutal killing of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955, the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in 1963, and the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 all serve as markers on the civil rights movement timeline, as did so many other killings of black men by white racists. Each tragic killing sparked nationwide protests and renewed activism in the struggle for civil rights and racial justice in the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>The killing of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012 was a pivotal marker of racial violence against black men in the twenty-first century. Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, a white man who called the police when he saw Martin walking in his neighborhood. Zimmerman, a member of a neighborhood crime watch group, reported to the police that Martin looked &#x201c;suspicious&#x201d; and that he looked like he was &#x201c;up to no good or on drugs or something.&#x201d; Ignoring the dispatcher&#x2019;s warning that he should not follow Martin, Zimmerman ultimately shot and killed him. Martin was unarmed and was on his way back to his father&#x2019;s house after buying snacks at a local convenience store. Initially Zimmerman was not even charged with a crime, but after nationwide protests, he was charged with Martin&#x2019;s murder. A jury ultimately acquitted him.<br>&nbsp;<br>The killing of Trayvon Martin, the initial failure of the pros�ecutor to charge Zimmerman with a crime, and Zimmerman&#x2019;s ultimate acquittal captured the attention of the nation. Presi�dent Obama even weighed in, stating, &#x201c;Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&#x201d; Martin&#x2019;s killing also inspired the phrase &#x201c;Black Lives Matter.&#x201d; The phrase trended on Twitter and all forms of social media and was displayed on posters carried in protests after Martin&#x2019;s killing and after every killing of a black man or woman by a police officer from that day forward. Black Lives Matter ultimately became a social justice movement with chapters throughout the United States and Canada.<br>&nbsp;<br>Many unarmed black men and boys have been killed since Trayvon Martin&#x2019;s tragic death five years ago. Many of the kill�ings occurred after police officers arguably engaged in racial profiling&#x2014;stopping and harassing these men for no explainable reason other than the color of their skin. In all of the cases where black men were shot and killed, the officers claimed that they felt threatened, even though the men were unarmed and often running away or retreating. In almost all of the cases, the police officers were never arrested or charged with a crime.<br>&nbsp;<br>The tragic killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, and others served as the catalyst for this anthology. But these killings also inspired the contributing authors to think about all of the ways that black men are &#x201c;policed&#x201d;&#x2014;in the broad sense of the word&#x2014;heavily and harshly at every step of the criminal process. In fact, black men are policed and treated worse than their similarly situated white counterparts at every step of the criminal justice system, from arrest through sentencing. These unwarranted disparities exist whether black men are charged with crimes or are victims of crimes. Police officers stop, search, and arrest black men far more frequently than white men engaged in the same behavior. Prosecutors charge black men more frequently and with more serious crimes than white men who engage in the same behavior. And there are disproportionate numbers of black men in the nation&#x2019;s prisons and jails. Criminal defendants, regardless of their race, are punished less harshly when their vic�tims are black men. This anthology explores and explains the &#x201c;policing&#x201d; of black men&#x2014;from slavery to the present day and at every stage of the criminal process and beyond.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Why Black Men?</b><br>Black men are not the only people of color to be treated worse than their similarly situated white counterparts at every step of the criminal process. Black women, Latino/a men and women, Native Americans, and other people of color also experience vio�lence at the hands of the state and discriminatory treatment in the criminal justice system, as do people who are gay, lesbian, and/or transgender. This book&#x2019;s focus on black men in no way trivializes the experiences of all people who face these harms.<br>&nbsp;<br>While acknowledging that other groups have been and con�tinue to be oppressed and discriminated against, this book focuses on black men. In many ways, the experience of black men in the criminal justice system is unique. The most noticeable difference is that they are impacted more adversely than any other demo�graphic in the United States&#x2014;at every stage of the process.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Black Boys Are Disproportionately Arrested and Detained</b><br>Black boys are more likely to be referred to the juvenile jus�tice system than any other children. In 2011, black boys rep�resented the greatest percentage of children placed in juvenile detention&#x2014;903 black boys per 100,000 were sent to detention as compared to 125 black girls. A Rhode Island study found that black boys were 9.3 times more likely to spend time in juvenile detention than white boys.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over half the students arrested at school in the United States and referred to the juvenile justice system are black or His�panic. While black students represent only 16 percent of stu�dent enrollment, they represent 27 percent of students referred to law enforcement and 31 percent of students subjected to in-school arrests. Black male students alone make up 18 percent of all referrals and arrests.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Black Men Are Disproportionately Arrested</b><br>African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites and 49 percent of black men can expect to be arrested at least once by age twenty-three compared to 44 percent of His�panic men and 38 percent of white men. Police officers are permitted to stop and frisk individuals if they have &#x201c;reasonable suspicion&#x201d; that crime is afoot and that the person is armed and dangerous. However, numerous studies have shown that the practice of racial profiling has resulted in black men being tar�geted and disproportionately stopped, frisked, and arrested.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, the New York Civil Liberties Union analyzed the New York Police Department&#x2019;s 2011 stop-and-frisk database and found that 41.6 percent of all stops were of black and Latino men between the ages of fourteen and twenty-four, even though they make up only 4.7 percent of the population of New York. The same study found that no crime had been committed in 90 percent of the stops. Black men were disproportionately stopped. The number of stops of black men exceeded the city&#x2019;s entire population of black men by 9,720.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Black Men Are More Likely to Be Killed or Injured During a Police Encounter</b><br>While more whites are killed by law enforcement than people of color, African Americans are killed at a disproportionate rate. In fact, black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. Between 2010 and 2012, black boys ages fif�teen through nineteen were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million compared to 1.47 per million for white boys of the same age group. In addition, a significant number of black men killed by police were unarmed. Data collected from January 1, 2015, to May 31, 2015, revealed that African Americans killed by the police were twice as likely to be unarmed as whites.17 An over�whelming 95 percent of these victims were men.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not all violent encounters with the police result in death, but black men fare worse in&nbsp;nonfatal encounters as well. A study conducted by the Justice Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Justice Statis�tics (BJS) examined police use of nonfatal force between 2002 and 2011. The study found that African Americans were more likely to experience nonfatal force at the hands of police officers than either Hispanics or whites.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Black Men Are Disproportionately Imprisoned and Receive Longer Sentences</b><br>African Americans make up approximately 35 percent of the prison population in the United States, and by the end of 2015, black <i>men </i>constituted 34 percent of the American prison popula�tion. In 2015, 5,165 in 100,000 black men ages twenty-five to twenty-nine were imprisoned compared to 2,165 Hispanic men and 921 white men of the same ages. Remarkably, the number of black men in prison or jail, on probation, or on parole by the end of 2009 roughly equaled the number enslaved in 1850. One in three black men born in 2001 can expect to be incarcer�ated in his lifetime.<br>&nbsp;<br>Black men serve more time for their crimes than others simi�larly situated. Data collected by the U.S. Sentencing Commis�sion between December 2007 and 2011 revealed that black men in federal prisons received sentences 19.5 percent longer than white men sentenced for the same crime. Blacks are also dis�proportionately sentenced to death. As of 2014, the national death row population is approximately 42 percent black, while the overall black population is only 13.6 percent.<br><br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>For all of these reasons, this anthology focuses on the plight of black men and boys. The extraordinarily disproportionate mis�treatment of black boys and men at every step of the criminal process is explored in depth. As the essays make clear, the issues and problems are complex, as are the solutions. The authors are scholars, lawyers, and activists who have studied and, in some instances, personally experienced the phenomena about which they write. In these informative, well-researched, and sometimes poignant essays, the authors examine and explain the policing of the black man.</p><h2>Batman: Year Two 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition</h2><p>Celebrating 30 years comes this amazing collection of classic Mike Barr comics from his iconic Batman series, BATMAN: YEAR TWO 30th ANNIVERSARY DELUXE EDITION.<br><br>A close friend of Bruce Wayne introduces him to Rachel Caspian, and the two quickly develop a romantic relationship.

Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. In the nonmagic human world--the world of "Muggles"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. <p> A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: "We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, first published in England as <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>. (Ages 8 to 13) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>The beloved first book of the Harry Potter series, now fully illustrated by award-winning artist Jim Kay. For the first time, J. K. Rowling&#39;s beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Rowling herself selected artist Jim Kay, whose over 100 illustrations make this deluxe format as perfect a gift for the child being introduced to the series as for the dedicated fan. Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#39;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#39;t had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.</p><h2>Crafty Little Things to Sew: 20 Clever Sewing Projects Using Scraps &amp; Fat Quarters</h2><p><b>Adorable must-have items to sew in a session or two . . . even if you&#x2019;re a total beginner!</b><br> Start a project&#x2014;and finish on the very same day!

In separate investigations that spanned years and coasts, Falco risked his life, suffering a fractured neck and a severely torn shoulder, working deep under cover to bring violent sociopaths to justice. </p><p>His dedication was profound; Falco spent almost three years infiltrating the Vagos gang and rose to second in command of the Victorville, California chapter. He even served time in San Bernardino's Murder Unit and endured solitary confinement to protect his cover and the investigations. Falco recorded confessions of gangland-style killings and nearly became a target himself before he sought refuge in the Witness Protection Program. But discontent to remain on the sidelines and motivated by a strong sense of duty, Falco eventually left the Program and volunteer his talents again to infiltrate the Mongols and Outlaws, rising in rank to Vice President of the Petersburg, Virginia Outlaws chapter.</p><p>His efforts culminated in sixty two arrests of members for various crimes, including assault and murder. Executing one of this country's most successful RICO prosecutions and effectively crippling the criminal enterprise, Falco's engrossing narrative of the dangers of the biker underworld harkens back to Hunter S.

He looked grizzled, early forties, a tweaker the <i>Daily Press</i> later identified as James Gavin (aka Little Jimmy), a man gunned down &#x201c;in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#x201d; One surviving victim, a woman with lazy eyes and skinny shadows, recounted how two strange men opened fire in her living room. One bullet pierced Little Jimmy&#x2019;s back and penetrated his heart as he fled into the street. Blood spurted from the hole in her own arm and formed dark mosaics on the tile. <br>Everything happened like flash film, according to the woman, quick hot bursts on a white screen. Sounds amplified, loud bangs, muffled screams, the front door slammed shut like a cough in deep summer. The intended victim had curiously left minutes before the intruders stormed the house. He said he felt &#x201c;spooked&#x201d; and set up for a drug rip. <br>No one guessed the gangland murder had the Vagos&#x2019; signature. <br>No one knew anything about the killer. <br>No one except me, and technically, I didn&#x2019;t exist. <br>Eight months earlier, November 2003, Victor Valley Chapter <br>San Bernardino County, California, with its thinly populated deserts and high mountains, was home to the Vagos Motorcycle Club, an outlaw biker gang composed mostly of ex-military personnel, known as &#x201c;violent predators&#x201d; and dubbed the &#x201c;largest urban terrorist&#x201d; organization in the United States by San Bernardino County DA Michael A. Ramos. Intelligence sources warned that the Vagos, known as &#x201c;the Green Nation,&#x201d; posed an &#x201c;extreme threat&#x201d; to law enforcement. Members had purportedly infiltrated public safety agencies, operating as moles, securing sworn and nonsworn positions, and working undercover to obstruct and dismantle police investigations. <br>&#x201c;Can you get inside?&#x201d; Detective Samantha Kiles1 of the San Bernardino Sheriff&#x2019;s Department (SBSD) challenged me one chilly morning before Thanksgiving 2003. She sat across from me in a room in the department&#x2019;s Criminal Intelligence Division and warmed her hands on her coffee mug. A petite blonde with an affable smile, Kiles disarmed. Trim and fit, she looked every bit a marathon runner. Fiercely determined, she watched me with the steady gaze of a predator sizing up her prey. At six foot three I towered over Kiles even seated. I had no experience with the biker subculture, had never ridden or owned a Harley. Moreover, I didn&#x2019;t look like a biker. When I smuggled narcotics for the Bulgarian mob, I blended in as a businessman, clean-cut, sharply dressed, no tattoos. But I faced a minimum sentence of twenty-two years in prison for conspiracy to distribute and manufacture a hundred pounds of methamphetamine, so it was in my best interest to cooperate. And I had already been betrayed by my so-called &#x201c;loyal&#x201d; minions. <br>&#x201c;You grew up here.&#x201d; Kiles took a sip. True. And I had already proved my reliability as a confidential informant (CI) for the U.S. Customs and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Newly released from pretrial house arrest, I now had mobility to work more complex cases, not just drug deals or cartels but gangs. I had voiced as much to my &#x201c;handler&#x201d; at the DEA, and he had connected me to Kiles. <br>&#x201c;I know skinheads,&#x201d; I said and named gangs where I could easily blend in as a Caucasian male. But more than any other group, Kiles advised, the Vagos terrorized Southern California. <br>My poverty-stricken childhood as a white sore in a Hispanic barrio flashed in my mind&#x2019;s eye. Freedom had one exit and I took it: I became a drug dealer, my life consumed by smuggling large quantities of cocaine from South America to Europe. Money motivated me and I had talent. At the time I justified my activities with my own felonious code of ethics&#x2014;at least I wasn&#x2019;t a snitch or a child rapist. And as the drug market evolved from cocaine to methamphetamine, I became a cook, earning half a million dollars a year. As I shuffled from room to room in my spacious mansion with its white walls and fancy leather furniture, I struggled to save the illusion even as my addiction ravaged me. Money blew around me, smacked into the ceiling fans, fluttered into the street like confetti. My expensive cars disappeared, repossessed. My wife left. Sweat drenched me. I paced the halls, slammed each door shut, worried that the shadow people might find me. Without electricity, my house became an inferno. <br>Foil covered my windows, blocking the sunlight. My life continued without definition, hour after hour of endless monotony. I closed my eyes and hoped no one saw me. Pounding at my front door, loud, crisp shouts: <i>Police. Open up.</i> I raced to the nearest bathroom. On my knees, hands shaking, I flushed drugs down the toilet. Water splashed onto my cheeks. My head clouded with noise. Black-clad bodies crashed through my bathroom door, their raid jackets announcing in bold white letters LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF SWAT TEAM. MP5 machine guns targeted my chest and red laser beams framed my heart, yet I felt sudden relief. <br>Other federal agencies had launched several unsuccessful investigations into the Vagos. Four or five times the size of the Hells Angels in Southern California, the gang&#x2019;s violence was legion, and law enforcement had become increasingly alarmed as the Vagos&#x2019; penchant for brutal and unprovoked assaults, firearms trafficking, distribution and sale of dangerous narcotics, extortion, loan-sharking, and murder spread from the biker scene into the general population. Like rats, the gang members lived deep in the city&#x2019;s sewers, foul and deadly. But the government had no interest in pest control; they needed extermination. <br>&#x201c;What do I have to do?&#x201d; I folded my arms across my chest, pumped for the assignment. Kiles briefed me on the Vagos&#x2019; history and growth: The club formed in the 1960s in San Bernardino City and spanned twenty-four chapters in Southern California, Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah with ten chapters in Mexico (Baja California, Jalisco, and Mexico City). The gang, originally called the Psychos, chose as its insignia Loki, the Norse god of mischief, riding a motorcycle. The gang had no official enemy, no incentive to declare war on rivals like the Hells Angels or Mongols. So-called fence riders, their power derived from their unpredictability and terror campaigns. The club subscribed to the philosophy that it was better to be feared than revered. They were the mafia on wheels but without the pretense of respectability or legitimacy. The Vagos never hid their brutality; they flaunted it. And whether their bravado derived from sheer machismo, raw animal instinct, or jockeying for position in the drug economy, their acts left a staggering body count. <br>&#x201c;Get inside, gather intelligence on the gang, identify the club&#x2019;s leaders, purchase drugs from them, and collect as many illegal firearms as you can,&#x201d; Kiles said and recited a list of bars the Vagos frequented within a forty-mile radius of my apartment. Members would not be difficult to spot, she continued. Outlaw biker gangs proudly flew their &#x201c;cuts,&#x201d; denim or leather sleeveless vests adorned with coded patches that signified a member&#x2019;s criminal and sexual achievements. They <i>wanted</i> the public to know they were outlaws, so-called one percenters who represented a minority of motorcycle enthusiasts responsible for committing 99 percent of all crime.2 <br>&#x201c;Look for officers.&#x201d; Kiles drained her coffee, but when I said I had no clue what officers were, she simplified: &#x201c;the green patch.&#x201d; Full-patch members wore a bottom rocker that announced CALIFORNIA and a top arc that displayed VAGOS. The triangular center patch reinforced the &#x201c;V&#x201d; of Vagos and depicted Loki. The name Vagos, though sounding vaguely Hispanic, actually stemmed from the word &#x201c;vagabond&#x201d;&#x2014;moving around&#x2014;and its membership was 70 percent white (the leadership, however, was Hispanic). <br>&#x201c;After that, you&#x2019;ll have to improvise.&#x201d; <br>My &#x201c;pay&#x201d; for my risk was time, not money. If I didn&#x2019;t want to spend the rest of my life behind bars, I would have to produce results. Twenty-two years tightened like a noose around my neck. I had no plan, no bike, and no government protection. I had never felt more alone. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At first, I took Kiles&#x2019;s lead and hung out at armpits like the Motherlode, hoping to eavesdrop on conversations with bikers as I shot pool and drank beer with patrons. The Vagos&#x2019; drinking cheer, &#x201c;Viva Los Vagos and butt fuck the rest,&#x201d; thundered through the place. Graffiti on the walls was a strange combination of reality and fantasy, from Grand Theft Auto gaming&#x2014;a fictional Hispanic street gang in Los Angeles at war with a fictional Grove Street gang. I watched members slam back shots. Stress coursed through me like an electric current. I lived in a dingy apartment thirty miles from the county line with my pit bull, Hercules. Each night I drove in the chilly darkness from my home to the bar, then back home, often stumbling in after three in the morning, dehydrated, hungry, sleep deprived, and anxious about beginning the charade again hours later. <br>After two weeks of nothing, I formulated a plan. <br>The Motherlode, situated in Hesperia, smelled rank, a mixture of beer, piss, and puke. Harleys lined the perimeter. Music pulsed like a frantic heartbeat. Dimly lit, hazy from cigarette smoke, cramped with pool tables, a jukebox, and green-tinted walls (in honor of the Vagos), the place buzzed with an undercurrent of violence. Several full-patch Vagos huddled together, beers in hand. The bartender, a rough-looking troll of a woman, slid a cold Bud across the counter toward me with hands that resembled slabs of meat. Green fluorescent lights flickered above the bar. Paraphernalia advertising Vagos&#x2019; parties (we called them &#x201c;runs&#x201d;) littered one corner. Conversation punctuated the noise like grunts. <br>My attention focused on an attractive brunette draped around a worn denim-clad biker who looked like something recovered from the trash. Dressed in black jeans, shirtless, with tattoos covering every inch of his arms and a green swastika tattoo across his protruding belly. A grisly handlebar mustache framed his mouth. A green bandanna covered his tightly cropped hair. The number 22 was displayed prominently on his left arm, for the twenty-second letter of the alphabet: &#x201c;V&#x201d; for Vagos. The woman glanced at me, and her expression lacked the haunted, vacant look of an addict. Color washed her cheeks. She had glossy hair and teeth. I wanted to rescue her. <i>What was she doing with him?</i> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Vinny&#x2019;s old lady,&#x201d; a tweaker (meth addict) next to me volunteered over the noise. The woman offered a startling contrast. She was clearly a misfit among misfits, strangely protected as the property of Vinny. No random bikers pawed her or passed her around their laps, unlike the tweaker, a waiflike bleached blonde, who fluttered in the shadows like a fly, landing randomly on bikers who cruelly swatted her away. I snapped my fingers at the troll bartender. I had found opportunity: women. <br>&#x201c;Can I buy you a beer?&#x201d; <br>My heart raced as I approached Vinny&#x2019;s table. He frowned menacingly at me and left the chilly bottle sweating next to him. He resembled a bull&#x2014;stocky, spun tight, and ready to charge the gate at the first sound of gunfire. Young, maybe midthirties, he had the hardened look of tough leather. I eased the tension between us through flattery, told him I admired the Vagos, especially after one had defended me in jail. Vinny bought the lie and drained his beer. His girlfriend also approved. She smiled at me and introduced me to her pals at the table: Bandit, Cornfed, Spoon, Truck. They formed a green blur of patches. We exchanged few words. Mostly we stared at each other. The woman smiled. I smiled at her. Truck spread over two seats. I struggled for an opening, something that might connect us. It was a little like being at a table with large blow-up dolls. <br>Then action broke the awkward silence. Vinny scowled and motioned to a patron seated at the bar. The letters &#x201c;IE&#x201d; (for Inland Empire in the Riverside&#x2013;San Bernardino area) were prominent on the back of his neck. Clearly an outsider. Vinny&#x2019;s face flushed and he stood without a word, curled his hand into a fist, and slammed it into the man&#x2019;s temple. The startled gang member fell backward, grabbed his head, stumbled outside with his wife in tow, and climbed into his white Suburban. The sound of tires peeling made my heart race. And then the scene outside played in slow motion as the Suburban plowed through the Vagos&#x2019; motorcycles, knocking over Vinny&#x2019;s in the process. <br>The kickstand gouged the asphalt. <i>Game on.</i> Just like that, my first meaningful night of Vagos infiltration was over before it even began. As bikes hit the pavement, Vagos emptied the bar like so many roaches and chased the Suburban into the street. Truck puffed to the curb and jotted down the license plate. Sweat poured from his temple. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find out where he lives.&#x201d; He slipped the note into his pocket. Undeterred by the cops&#x2019; presence, he added, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take care of business.&#x201d; Instinctively I knew what that meant. The Vagos planned to hunt down the gang member, drag him to a desolate place, and show him the meaning of respect. No exchange of insurance information or beating. The Vagos, if they found their victim, likely intended to stomp the driver, demolish his Suburban, smash the headlights, kick in the car doors, break the windows, and gut the engine. There would be no &#x201c;victim&#x201d; and no police report, no prosecution. Fear of retaliation by club members would silence him. <br>Later, sitting on the edge of my bed, Hercules&#x2019; head on my knee, I reported the threat to Kiles but knew even as I did that there was little hope her department could stop the certain violence. The victim would become part of the human debris, another nameless figure in a terror war without rules. I realized then that I didn&#x2019;t want just to <i>report</i> intelligence to Kiles. I wanted to make a dent, to get inside the Vagos&#x2019; organization, befriend the leadership, <i>be</i> a Vago. <br>But how did I do that without a bike, protection, or money? <br>After the incident at the Motherlode, the troll banned the Vagos from her bar. Vinny regrouped at Hustlers, a dive thirty miles from my apartment. The place resembled a sweaty cave. Smoke lingered in the air and cast a ghostly glow over the members&#x2019; faces as they huddled over beer and discussed their next motorcycle run. Their goal was always to &#x201c;black out&#x201d; police surveillance and to party uninhibited in deserted areas. But even serious discussion yielded to distraction, to Terrible, a neo-Nazi lowrider and longtime hang-around for the Victorville Vagos chapter. He personified violence: chiseled features, tattooed .22 on his neck, pierced forehead, and two protruding flesh devil horns. He had already consumed five beers in the span of an hour when he boasted that his brother, Robbery, had shot a man in the face. The confession sputtered out of him like a defective spark. My recorder clicked inside my jockstrap. I had removed the cup and tucked the device into the flap between my legs. My underwear secured it in place, and unless someone grabbed me in the crotch, I was fairly sure I was safe from detection. <br>Terrible gave me a swift lesson in payback. &#x201c;A guy owed him money. He fell asleep behind the wheel, wrecked his car, and spent two months in the hospital in back traction.&#x201d; His laugh strangled out of him as if he were unused to talking. I nodded. <i>Payback.</i> Terrible twitched beside me, growing increasingly agitated by the sudden lull in the conversation, the irregular gaps. He seemed unaware that his story about his brother began in the middle, as if we had met bef...</p><h2>What is Lean Six Sigma</h2><p><p><b>A quick introduction on how to use Lean Six Sigma to improve your workplace, meet your goals, and better serve your customers.</b></p> <p>Lean Six Sigma combines the two most important improvement trends of our time: making work <i>better</i> (using Six Sigma) and making work <i>faster</i> (using Lean principles).

The climate is temperate, with relatively harsh winters and extremely hot and humid summers that, in recent years, approximate tropical conditions due in part to two centuries of intensive land clearing and industrial practices. The island&#x2019;s longitude is 40�43'42" N, and its latitude is 73�59'39" W.<br> <br>Island dwellers live in a state of ecological release&#x2014;resources such as food and water are abundant and easily procured; disease is minimal; there is no predation. Living in a niche characterized by literally unprecedented abundance, untethered from hardship, the wealthiest islanders are able to invest heavily in each and every offspring and to invent elaborate and complex social codes and rites, the observance of which are time-, labor-, and resource-intensive.<br> <br>In spite of the extraordinary abundance of food, water, and other resources island-wide, there is persistent and marked poverty in some areas. The isolation, extreme population density, and vast discrepancies in wealth, as well as traditionally gender-scripted roles and behaviors around child rearing and work, may inform and in part account for many of the strange-seeming behaviors of the wealthiest island dwellers, discussed in the following pages.<br> Island dwellings<p></p> <br>The island&#x2019;s inhabitants are primarily vertical dwellers, making their homes directly on top of one another in structures of finely ground stone. Living in these &#x201c;vertical villages&#x201d; allows inhabitants to maximize physical space, a precious commodity in short supply on their tiny and remarkably densely populated island. In some locations, particularly where the wealthiest islanders reside, these vertical villages are notably restrictive, with a secretive &#x201c;council of elders&#x201d; presiding over who will and will not be allowed to live there. Scouting out a dwelling is one of the most labor-intensive practices of the female members of the tribe I studied&#x2014;most often the task is undertaken by primaparas. Almost without exception, &#x201c;dwelling shamans&#x201d; guide these women in their quests for homes&#x2014;which are also quests for identity. The shamans offer specialized knowledge, counsel, and emotional support throughout this costly, protracted, and painstaking initiation process.<br> Geographical origins of islanders<p></p> <br>Island dwellers have heterogeneous geographical origins. Many dispersed at sexual maturity from their natal groups in distant, smaller, and even rural villages, immigrating to the island for enhanced professional, sexual, and marital prospects. Other island dwellers are indigenous; their status is higher than that of the nonautochthonous residents, particularly if they were raised in certain corners of the island or attended particular &#x201c;learning huts&#x201d; while growing up there.<br> Beliefs of and about islanders<p></p> <br>Whether they are autochthonous or �migr�s, island dwellers are believed by outsiders, many visitors, and their countrymen to harbor haughty attitudes about themselves and their island. They are known throughout the land for their brusqueness; intellectual gifts; dazzling adornment practices; and acumen in barter, trade, and negotiation. Increasingly, their trade is in invisible ideas and abstractions, enhancing the sense that they have privileged knowledge and even &#x201c;magical&#x201d; powers. The journeys and tribulations of those who move to the island and struggle to succeed there are the stuff of legend, literally&#x2014;there exists a long oral and written tradition about the supposedly indomitable and unique spirit of people who are able to &#x201c;make it there.&#x201d; Once they have established themselves on the island, it is said, they can &#x201c;make it anywhere.&#x201d;<br> Resource acquisition and distribution<p></p> <br>On the whole, the island dwellers are the richest in the entire nation, living untethered from the environmental constraints that have such a profound impact on life-history courses in other habitats worldwide. Obtaining adequate calories for themselves and their children, the main ecological challenge to parents worldwide and throughout our evolutionary prehistory, is a simple given for wealthy island dwellers. However, as in many industrial and postindustrial societies, fathers of the very traditionally gender-scripted tribe I studied tend to focus on the job of provisioning their wives and families with less-tangible resources, including financial, social, and cultural capital. While many island-dwelling females work outside the home, during the childbearing and child-rearing years, many wealthy female islanders believe it is their &#x201c;role&#x201d; to remain home with their children, where they are often assisted by alloparents&#x2014;individuals other than parents who take on parental roles. They call these alloparents &#x201c;housekeepers,&#x201d; &#x201c;nannies,&#x201d; and &#x201c;caregivers.&#x201d;<br> Island organization<p></p> <br>The island is organized, in the minds of island dwellers, into four quadrants: Up, Down, Right, and Left. The &#x201c;Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;Down&#x201d; areas are believed to be markedly distinct&#x2014;with Up being preferable for raising children and Down being considered primarily a place for pre-reproductives, cultural &#x201c;outsiders,&#x201d; feasting, and ecstatic nighttime rites. Islanders further divide their island into left and right hemispheres. &#x201c;Left&#x201d; and &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; like &#x201c;Up&#x201d; and &#x201c;Down,&#x201d; are believed to have different&#x2014;even polar opposite&#x2014;characteristics. Left is believed to be more casual and progressive, in contrast to Right&#x2019;s perceived formality and conservatism.</p><h2>Rainbow in the Cloud: The Wisdom and Spirit of Maya Angelou</h2><p>&#x201c;Words mean more than what is set down on paper,&#x201d; Maya Angelou wrote in her groundbreaking memoir <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i>.

There is a moment to speak, a tone of voice to be used, words to be carefully chosen, a time to drop one&#x2019;s eyes, and a split-�second when a stranger can be touched on the shoulder or arm or even knee without conveying anything more than respectful friendliness. A lone woman in a new situation knows it is correct to smile slightly at the other women, never grin (a grin is proper only between friends or people making friendship), and nod to unknown men. This behavior tells the company that the new woman is ready to be friendly but is not thirsting after another woman&#x2019;s mate. She should be sensual, caring for her appearance, but taking special care to minimize her sexuality.<br><br>Every family in our country has someone, a daughter, a son, a nephew, a niece, a cousin, who has served or is serving in the armed services.

Men and women posing as prophets and apostles make millions preying on the sick, poor, and emotionally fragile. Behind a veil of glamour, many self-proclaimed pastors mask their spiritual abuse with claims of special power from the Holy Spirit. Defining Deception pulls back the curtain to reveal the truth behind this lucrative industry. Written with a unique blend of theology, history, and personal experience, Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood have lovingly, yet sternly, exposed the mystical-miracle fraud in the hope that Christians will unite against those who have turned Jesus into a commodity. It is also a call to all Christians of good faith to help those trapped by these corrupt leaders rediscover the biblical Gospel of Christ. Every Christian is called to &#x201c;earnestly contend for the faith&#x201d; (Jude 3) even when it&#x2019;s controversial&#x2014;Defining Deception will equip Christians to do just that.</p><p>Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood are committed to exposing deceptions surrounding the modern &#x201c;mystical-miracle&#x201d; movement. Both have written and spoken extensively on the matter, describing it as, &#x201c;Attempting to corrupt the evangelical church from the inside...&#x201d; Costi is the nephew of notorious &#x201c;faith healer&#x201d; Benny Hinn and grew up entrenched within the inner circle of greed and chicanery. Anthony founded a 2,000 person weekly ministry to college students and participated in conferences and television specials by infamous televangelists. These unique backgrounds inspire each man&#x2019;s holy zeal for people to know the dangers involved with false teaching and false promises. Hinn&#x2019;s testimony and response to &#x201c;The Prosperity Gospel&#x201d; have recently been featured on CNN and Christianity Today. Wood&#x2019;s posts on modern faith forgeries have been read by hundreds of thousands. Hinn and Wood are humbled to share the story of how God rescued them out of the growing miracle-mystical movement and have a deep passion to help modern evangelicalism experience the life saving faith provided in the pure and simple teaching of Holy Scripture.<p>To their credit, Hinn and Wood make an evenhanded examination of the strange phenomena and distinctive doctrines currently emanating from Bethel and coursing through the charismatic community. This is a well-written, well-documented, honest, careful, courageous, and biblically sound look at a worldwide movement that threatens to reshape and redefine Christianity. What Hinn and Wood have given us is an invaluable resource that could well prove to be one of the most important books of the decade.</p> <p><strong>Dr. John F. MacArthur</strong></p> <p>Pastor-Teacher of Grace Community Church, Sun Valley, California, President of The Master&#x2019;s University and Seminary, and<br> President of Grace to You</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a new Christian, I spent nearly a decade in the Mystical-Miracle Move-ment. I saw firsthand the false teachings, deception, and harm that this movement has wrought. I am very grateful that Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood have written this work, exposing the teachers and teachings of the Mystical-Miracle movement. What they say is spot on! In a day when the church&#x2019;s discernment is at a historical low, this book is much needed.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Michael Vlach</strong></p> <p>Professor of Theology, The Master&#x2019;s Seminary, Sun Valley, California</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The truth has hard edges. Even when two caring shepherds speak it in love, sometimes it still stings. For those who are quick to high-five any who say &#x2018;I love Jesus&#x2019; a book like this may be an uncomfortable read. But it&#x2019;s important. Defining Deception will do the crucial work of tracing the background, identifying the key players, and explaining the damage that the latest wave of sign-seeking is doing to the Christ&#x2019;s Church. Hinn and Wood have provided a valuable resource in this timely work. I encourage you get a copy for yourself and for any you know who are being lured into this so-called &#x201c;Apostolic Reformation.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Dr. Mike Fabarez</strong></p> <p>Pastor of Compass Bible Church, Aliso Viejo, California</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was reared in the Pentecostal-Charismatic movement. I came to a knowledge of Jesus and basic Bible truths through the teaching of my parents, and godly teachers in my church. But not all Pentecostals and Charismatic share the same emphases. The authors of&nbsp;Defining Deception: Freeing the Church from the Mystical-Miracle Movement&nbsp;take care to distinguish standard Pentecostalism from the extreme miracle movements of Word-Faith and Third Wave Charismatic movements. Whereas historic Pentecostalism, for the most part, has adhered to orthodox Christianity, new Charismatic preachers and churches often deviate from the Bible in the teachings regarding the biblical doctrines of revelation, God, Jesus, and salvation. Leaders of the Word-Faith Movement and the Third Wave tend to emphasize subjective experience, rather than theology, money rather than people, and deceit rather than transparency. Hinn and Wood carefully and irenically expose false teachers and false doctrines and deceptive methods, but with due concern for accuracy and thoroughness, and explain well the difference between the nature of biblical miracles with the tricks and illusions of the &#x201c;signs and wonders&#x201d; teaching and teachers. This book will help persons who find themselves in the &#x201c;miracles&#x201d; movement, and provide a rationale for them to develop a more biblical teaching on miracles and relationship with Jesus.</p> <p><strong>Dr. H. (Hershel) Wayne House</strong></p> <p>Vice-President of Academic Affairs and Distinguished Professor of Theology, Law, and Culture, Faith International University, Faith Seminary, Tacoma, Washington</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I&#x2019;m sure Defining Deception was not an easy book for the authors to write. It&#x2019;s never easy to expose error without doing so in brush strokes that are too broad. Hinn and Wood are not diminishing the influence of the Pentecostalism around the world. Indeed, there are places that if Pentecostal assemblies were not present, there would be no gospel of any kind present. What the authors strive to do is identify the bad apples in the barrel, those who have taken a deliberate leap into theological error and practice. Those who have twisted beyond recognition the pure Word of God. Their task is not an enviable one, but the outcome has been worth the risk.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Woodrow Kroll</strong></p> <p>Former President and Senior Bible Teacher for Back to the Bible</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When false teaching crept into the church, Jude laid aside his desire to write about the church&#x2019;s common salvation in order to expose and oppose false teachers. In Defining Deception Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood have done the same. Pulling no punches, Hinn and Wood have written a well-documented book that warns the church of the dangers of New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a sprawling movement that is rife with false miracles and abuses of the Bible. For Christians unfamiliar with the origin, extent, and teaching of NAR, this book provides a theological history and a biblically-grounded refutation. It is a timely book that counters a pervasive form of false teaching today. May the Lord use Defining Deception to guard the true apostolic faith, rescue sheep ensnared by false teaching, and build up the church of Jesus Christ.</p> <p><strong>Dr. David Schrock</strong></p> <p>Adjunct Professor of Systematic Theology, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky, and Pastor of Preaching and Theology, Occoquan Bible Church, Woodbridge, Virginia</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;There is nothing new under the sun. Many times current untruths are nothing more than old repackaged heresies and Anthony Wood and Costi Hinn do a marvelous job of reaching into the spirit of our age and pulling us back to biblical boundaries. I&#x2019;m thankful they&#x2019;ve handled such a sensitive topic and helped us love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Mark Lee</strong></p> <p>Lead Pastor of VantagePoint Church, Eastvale, California</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Words cannot express the enthusiasm I have for this book. Hundreds of millions of professing believers have been deceived by the soul-destroying heresies of the Word-Faith/New Apostolic Reformation movement. False teachers like Benny Hinn, Bill Johnson and others like them, past and present, have claimed false visions, uttered false prophecies, promoted fake miracles and have exploited the poor, the sick, the desperate and the widows for decades. Worst of all is that these wolves have distorted the very Gospel itself and sullied the name of Jesus Christ. I am profoundly grateful for this excellent resource given to us by Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood. Defining Deception will not only help you to understand the deadly dangers of this movement, it will also equip you to speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15) to those trapped in it and, by God's grace, see them delivered by truth. I joyfully commend this work to you.</p> <p><strong>Justin Peters</strong></p> <p>Evangelist<em>,</em> Author of Clouds Without Water</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no question that the church today is at a loss in explaining the existence and veracity of the modern charismatic movement. In Defining Deception: Freeing the Church from the Mystical-miracle Movement, Costi W. Hinn and Anthony G. Wood have helped us understand this movement from the inside. These are men who experience the errors from within and now are speaking out against it. Their explanation is thorough, lucid, and charitable. In their winsome way, they help the believer come to grips with the dangers of the movement and the importance of Biblical literacy in the life of the church. In addition, their application to a contemporary church makes the lessons in the book practical and applicable. I learned much from these authors and recommend it as a source both in comprehending the movement and in helping others avoid it and even come out of it.</p> <p><strong>Dr. Alex Montoya</strong></p> <p>Pastor of First Fundamental Bible Church, Whittier, California</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>*************************</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2 Chronicles 5:14, when the glory of God filled the temple in a cloud, the priests could not stand and minister nor could they enter. They ra-ther fell on their faces in reference. Yet Bethel Church in Redding, CA, regularly boasts that God visits them in glory clouds: gold glitter that falls from the ceiling during their worship services which they dance in and take pictures of. Worse than fooling people with their charismatic fakery is Bethel's false teaching, leading many astray from the sound words of our Lord Christ. Costi Hinn and Anthony Wood have done a judicious job with this book, not just alerting readers to the latest stream of char-ismaticism but educating about its earliest influences. They are pastoral and needfully direct, all in keeping with the command to hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, and rebuke those who contradict it (Ti-tus 1:9).</p> <p><strong>Gabriel Hughes</strong></p> <p>Voice and creator, When We Understand the Text (WWUTT)</p></p><h2>Linda Goodman&#39;s Star Signs</h2><p>The Master Astrologer's Classic Spiritual and Physical Self-Help Guide<br><br>She has helped millions improve their lives, loves, and businesses through her bestselling books, Sun Signs and Love Signs.

I'd like to talk about chickens, the laying eggs kind, but first I should introduce myself! I'm Rayzel Lam, mostly known online as "hcgchica." :) After losing close to 50 lbs with the hCG protocol and maintaining my weight loss since late 2012, I learned a lot about what works and doesn't work on this diet. I have communicated with thousands of other hCGers through private email. All this has allowed me to create something for you guys that I think will be truly helpful in achieving your goals. I've created this based on info from the real world. <p><b>On a more personal note,</b> I love long walks on the beach...nah, just kidding. Actually my true love is the mountains and I also relish creating things with my hands. Relish. It just occurred to me that it's very strange that relish means both to enjoy greatly but is also something I can put on a hot dog. Weird. </p><p><b>In my off time you will find me</b> quilting, taking photos, and painting random furniture I find on the side of the road in vivid colors. I taught my son to read when he was three and a half, something I feel very proud of. He is now 5 and reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder books by himself. </p> <p>If there are ever stocks to be had in the Stevia industry, I should definitely buy some because I'm positive my stevia consumption keeps that market humming!</p> <p><b>My husband of 14 years</b> and I danced to Mariah Carey's <i>All I Ever Wanted</i>at our wedding and I did not feel nervous about marrying him on our wedding day at all because I knew he was <i>the</i> person for me. We've been best friends since I was 15.</p> <p><b>My weakness</b> that you'll likely discover all too soon is that I reiterate myself too much. I guess you could call me an over-communicator. Which then you might find it surprising to know that I love being alone.</p> <p><b>I've been an avid Crossfitter</b> for over 3 years now and I have no idea why picking up a heavy weight just to set it down again is fun but it is. I joke with my 185 pound husband that if he was shaped like a barbell I could now deadlift him.</p> <p>I have no pets because I'm allergic to pretty much most animals. Except chickens. I do good with chickens. Which reminds me I can't wait to purchase a new flock next spring.......</p></p><h2>Lion Lessons</h2><p><b>With the wit and read-aloud appeal of Peter Brown&#x2019;s <i>Children Make Terrible Pets</i> and William Steig&#x2019;s <i>Pete&#x2019;s a Pizza</i>, this funny, fierce picture book teaches kids just what it takes to be a great lion</b><br> &nbsp;<br> There are seven steps to becoming a proper lion, including Looking Fierce, Roaring, Prowling Around, and Pouncing.

Vivid recollections waited to ambush me whenever my mind wandered.</p> <p>Encompassed by the blackness, I remembered white-hot f lames stabbing at my face. Though my hands had been tied to a post that dug sharply into my back, I had recoiled from the onslaught. The fire had pulled away just before blistering my skin, but my eyebrows and eyelashes had long since been singed off.</p> <p>"Put the f lames out!" a man's rough voice had ordered. I blew at the blaze through cracked lips. Dried by fire and fear, the moisture in my mouth had gone and my teeth radiated heat as if they had been baked in an oven.</p> <p>"Idiot," he cursed. "Not with your mouth. Use your mind. Put the f lames out with your mind."</p> <p>Closing my eyes, I attempted to focus my thoughts on making the inferno disappear. I was willing to do anything, no matter how irrational, to persuade the man to stop.</p> <p>"Try harder." Once again the heat swung near my face, the bright light blinding me in spite of my closed eyelids.</p> <p>"Set her hair on fire," a different voice instructed. He sounded younger and more eager than the other man. "That should encourage her. Here, Father, let me."</p> I twisted to loosen the bonds that held me as my thoughts scat-tered into a mindless buzzing. A droning noise had echoed from my throat and grew louder until it had pervaded the room and quenched the f lames.<p></p> <p>The loud metallic clank of the lock startled me from my nightmarish memory. A wedge of pale yellow light sliced the darkness, then traveled along the stone wall as the heavy cell door opened. Caught in the lantern's glow, my eyes were seared by the brightness. I squeezed them shut as I cowered in the corner.</p> <p>"Move it, rat, or we'll get the whip!" Two dungeon guards attached a chain to the metal collar on my neck and hauled me to my feet. I stumbled forward, pain blazing around my throat. As I stood on trembling legs, the guards efficiently chained my hands behind me and manacled my feet.</p> <p>I averted my eyes from the f lickering light as they led me down the main corridor of the dungeon. Thick rancid air puffed in my face. My bare feet shuff led through puddles of unidentifiable muck.</p> <p>Ignoring the calls and moans of the other prisoners, the guards never missed a step, but my heart lurched with every word.</p> <p>"Ho, ho, ho, someone's gonna swing."</p> <p>"Snap! Crack! Then your last meal slides down your legs!"</p> <p>"One less rat to feed."</p> <p>"Take me! Take me! I wanna die too!"</p> <p>We stopped. Through squinted eyes I saw a staircase. In an effort to get my foot onto the first step, I tripped over the chains and fell. The guards dragged me up. The rough edges of the stone steps dug into my skin, peeling away exposed f lesh on my arms and legs. After being pulled through two sets of thick metal doors, I was dumped onto the f loor. Sunlight stabbed between my eyes. I shut them tight as tears spilled down my cheeks. It was the first time that I had seen daylight in seasons.</p> <p><i>This is it,</i> I thought, starting to panic. But the knowledge that my execution would end my miserable existence in the dungeon calmed me.</p> <p>Yanked to my feet again, I followed the guards blindly. My I stunk of rat. Given only a small ration of water, I didn't waste it on baths.</p> <p>Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked around. The walls were bare, without the fabled gold sconces and elaborate tapestries I had been told once decorated the castle's main hallways. The cold stone f loor was worn smooth in the middle. We were probably traveling along the hidden corridors used solely by the servants and guards. As we passed two open windows, I glanced out with a hunger that no food could satisfy.</p> <p>The bright emerald of the grass made my eyes ache. Trees wore cloaks of leaves. Flowers laced the footpaths and over-f lowed from barrels. The fresh breeze smelled like an expen-sive perfume, and I breathed deeply. After the acidic smells of a fine wine. Warmth caressed my skin. A soothing touch compared to the constantly damp and chilly dungeon.</p> <p>I guessed it was the beginning of the hot season, which meant that I had been locked in the cell for five seasons, one season shy of a full year. It seemed an excessively long time for someone scheduled for execution.</p> <p>Winded from the effort of marching with my feet chained, I was led into a spacious office. Maps of the Territory of Ixia and the lands beyond covered the walls. Piles of books on the f loor made walking a straight line difficult. Candles in various stages of use littered the room, singe marks evident on several papers that had gotten too close to the candle's f lame. A large wooden table, strewn with documents and ringed by half a dozen chairs, occupied the center of the room. At the back of the office a man sat at a desk. Behind him a square window gaped open, permitting a breeze to blow through his shoulder-length hair.</p> <p>I shuddered, causing the chains to clatter. From the whis-pered conversations between prison cells, I had determined that condemned prisoners were taken to an official to confess their crimes before being hanged.</p> <p>Wearing black pants and a black shirt with two red diamonds stitched on the collar, the man at the desk wore the uniform of an adviser to the Commander. His pallid face held no ex-pression. As his sapphire-blue eyes scanned me, they widened in surprise.</p> <p>Suddenly conscious of my appearance, I glanced down at my tattered red prison gown and dirty bare feet roughened with yellow calluses. Dirt-streaked skin showed through the rips in the thin fabric. My long black hair hung in greasy clumps. Sweat-soaked, I swayed under the weight of the chains.</p> <p>"A woman? The next prisoner to be executed is a woman?" <i>executed</i> aloud. The calm I'd established earlier f led me. I would have sunk sobbing to the f loor if the guards weren't with me. The guards tormented anyone who showed any weakness.</p> <p>The man tugged at the black ringlets of his hair. "I should have taken the time to reread your dossier." He shooed the guards away. "You're dismissed."</p> <p>When they were gone, he motioned me to the chair in front of his desk. The chains clanged as I perched on the edge.</p> <p>He opened a folder on his desk and scanned the pages. "Yelena, today may be your lucky day," he said.</p> <p>I swallowed a sarcastic reply. An important lesson I had mastered during my dungeon stay was never to talk back. I bowed my head instead, avoiding eye contact.</p> <p>The man was quiet for a while. "Well-behaved and respect-ful. You're starting to look like a good candidate."</p> <p>Despite the clutter of the room, the desk was neat. In addition to my folder and some writing implements, the only other items on the desk were two small, black statues glitter-ing with streaks of silver&#x2014;a set of panthers carved to lifelike perfection.</p> <p>"You've been tried and found guilty of murdering General Brazell's only son, Reyad." He paused, stroking his temple with his fingers. "That explains why Brazell's here this week, and why he has been unusually interested in the execution schedule." The man spoke more to himself than to me.</p> <p>Upon hearing Brazell's name, fear coiled in my stomach. I steadied myself with a reminder that I was soon to be out of his reach forever.</p> <p>The Territory of Ixia's military had come to power only a gen-eration ago, but the rule had produced strict laws called the Code of Behavior. During peacetime&#x2014;most of the time, strangely enough for the military&#x2014;proper conduct didn't allow the taking of a human life. If someone committed murder, the punishment was execution. Self-preservation or an accidental death were not considered acceptable excuses. Once found guilty, the murderer was sent to the Commander's dungeon to await a public hanging.</p> <p>"I suppose you're going to protest the conviction. Say you were framed or you killed out of self-defense." He leaned back in his chair, waiting with a weary patience.</p> <p>"No, sir," I whispered, all I could manage from unused vocal cords. "I killed him."</p> <p>The man in black straightened in his chair, shooting me a hard look. Then he laughed aloud. "This may work out better than I'd planned. Yelena, I'm offering you a choice. You can either be executed, or you can be Commander Ambrose's new food taster. His last taster died recently, and we need to fill the position."</p> <p>I gaped at him, my heart dancing. He had to be joking. He was probably amusing himself. Great way to get a laugh. Watch hope and joy shine on the prisoner's face, then smash it by sending the accused to the noose.</p> <p>I played along. "A fool would refuse the job." My voice rasped louder this time.</p> <p>"Well, it's a lifetime position. The training can be lethal. After all, how can you identify poisons in the Commander's food if you don't know what they taste like?" He tidied the papers in the folder.</p> <p>"You'll get a room in the castle to sleep, but most of the day you'll be with the Commander. No days off. No husband or children. Some prisoners have chosen execution instead. At least then they know exactly when they're going to die, rather than guessing if it's going to come with the next bite." He clicked his teeth together, a feral grin on his face.</p> Service to the Commander was better than the dungeon and infinitely better than the noose. Questions raced through my mind: I'm a convicted killer, how can they trust me? What would prevent me from killing the Commander or escaping?<p></p> <p>"Who tastes the Commander's food now?" I asked instead, afraid if I asked the other questions he'd realize his mistake and send me to the gallows.</p> <p>"I do. So I'm anxious to find a replacement. Also the Code of Behavior states that someone whose life is forfeit must be offered the job."</p> <p>No longer able to sit still, I stood and paced around the room, dragging my chains with me. The maps on the walls showed strategic military positions. Book titles dealt with security and spying techniques. The condition and amount of candles suggested someone who worked late into the night.</p> <p>I looked back at the man in the adviser's uniform. He had to be Valek, the Commander's personal security chief and leader of the vast intelligence network for the Territory of Ixia.</p> <p>"What shall I tell the executioner?" Valek asked.</p> <p>"I am not a fool."</p></p><h2>Color Your Own Great Paintings by Women Artists (Dover Art Masterpieces To Color)</h2><p>Thirty striking works by noted female artists appear in this eclectic collection.

Raymer are hurriedly flown to Oahu from the mainland. The divers have been given a Herculean task: rescue the sailors and Marines trapped below, and resurrect the pride of the Pacific fleet. <br><p>Now for the first time, the chief diver of the Pearl Harbor salvage operations, Cmdr. Edward C. Raymer, USN (Ret.), tells the whole story of the desperate attempts to save crewmembers caught inside their sinking ships. <i>Descent into Darkness</i> is the only book available that describes the raising and salvage operations of sunken battleships following the December 7th attack.<br></p><p>Once Raymer and his crew of divers entered the interiors of the sunken shipwrecks--attempting untested and potentially deadly diving techniques--they experienced a world of total blackness, unable to see even the faceplates of their helmets. By memorizing the ships' blueprints and using their sense of touch, the divers groped their way hundreds of feet inside the sunken vessels to make repairs and salvage vital war material. The divers learned how to cope with such unseen dangers as falling objects, sharks, the eerie presence of floating human bodies, and the constant threat of Japanese attacks from above.<br></p><p>Though many of these divers were killed or seriously injured during the wartime salvage operations, on the whole they had great success performing what seemed to be impossible jobs. Among their credits, Raymer's crew raised the sunken battleships <i>West Virginia</i>, <i>Nevada</i>, and <i>California</i>. After Pearl Harbor they moved on to other crucial salvage work off Guadalcanal and the sites of other great sea battles.</p></p><p>Commander Edward C. Raymer, USN (Ret.) served thirty years in the U.S. Navy. <i>Descent into Darkness</i> was his only book. He died in 1997.Within hours of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Raymer, an enlisted man, was on a plane headed from San Diego to Oahu. His primary mission: to act as chief diver in the operations to rescue men trapped in sunken battleships. Removing bodies, recovering material and raising the ships themselves could, and would, come later. In this compelling memoir, Raymer describes the multiple hazards of working inside wreckage-strewn warships under the handicaps imposed by available diving technology. Courage was at least as important as competence as the number of dives mounted and the law of averages shifted against the men who went down. Raymer details many harrowing incidents, including one in which he, an arachnophobe, began to panic when a spider stowed away in his diving suit began to crawl over his face in the middle of a dive. The narrative includes lighter passages as well, especially the depictions of how the divers spent their off-duty hours pursuing food, liquor and women. For all its drama and charm, however, Raymer's memoir is useful above all as a case study of the hands-on, un-bureaucratized approach to problem-solving that the U.S. brought to WWII from the beginning.

Although innocent and unaware of what was happening at the time, they eventually discovered the extent of their father's occupations: These men&#x2014;their fathers who were capable of loving their children and receiving love in return&#x2014;were leaders of the Third Reich, and would later be convicted as monstrous war criminals. For these children, the German defeat was an earth-shattering source of family rupture, the end of opulence, and the jarring discovery of Hitler's atrocities.<br><br> How did the offspring of these leaders deal with the aftermath of the war and the skeletons that would haunt them forever? Some chose to disown their past. Others did not. Some condemned their fathers; others worshiped them unconditionally to the end. In this enlightening book, which has been translated into eleven languages, Tania Crasnianski examines the responsibility of eight descendants of Nazi notables, caught somewhere between stigmatization, worship, and amnesia. By tracing the unique experiences of these children, she probes at the relationship between them and their fathers and examines the idea of how responsibility for the fault is continually borne by the descendants.</p><p>Tania Crasnianski was born in France of a German mother and French-Russian father. <i>Children of Nazis</i> is her first book.

From the acts he committed in Vietnam, to his battles with alcoholism, to the sudden loss of his beloved wife, Molly, his thoughts drift from one irreconcilable memory to the next. Images of ghosts pepper his reality. Robicheaux&#x2019;s only beacon remains serving as a detective in New Iberia, Louisiana.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s in that capacity that Robicheaux crosses paths with powerful mob boss, Tony Nemo. Tony has a Civil War sword he&#x2019;d like to give to Levon Broussard, a popular local author whose books have been adapted into major Hollywood films. Then there&#x2019;s Jimmy Nightengale, the young poster boy of New Orleans wealth and glamour. Jimmy&#x2019;s fond of Levon&#x2019;s work, and even fonder of his beautiful, enigmatic wife, Rowena. Tony thinks Jimmy can be a US Senator someday, and has the resources and clout to make it happen. There&#x2019;s something off about the relationship among these three men, and after a vicious assault, it&#x2019;s up to Robicheaux to uncover the truth &#x201c;in the barn-burner of a climax&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review).<br> <br>Complicating matters is the sudden death of the New Iberian local responsible for Molly&#x2019;s death; namely that Robicheaux&#x2019;s colleague thinks Robicheaux had something to do with it. As Robicheaux works to clear his name and make sense of the murder, a harrowing study of America emerges: this nation&#x2019;s abiding conflict between a sense of past grandeur and a legacy of shame, its easy seduction by demagogues and wealth, and its predilection for violence and revenge. &#x201c;It has been almost five years since James Lee Burke&#x2019;s last Dave Robicheaux novel, and it was absolutely worth the wait&#x201d; (Associated Press).</p><p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction. He&#x2019;s authored thirty-six novels and two short story collections.&nbsp;He lives in Missoula, Montana.Robicheaux <br><br> <br>LIKE AN EARLY nineteenth-century poet, when I have melancholy moments and feel the world is too much for us and that late and soon we lay waste to our powers in getting and spending, I&#x2019;m forced to pause and reflect upon my experiences with the dead and the hold they exert on our lives.<br> <br>This may seem a macabre perspective on one&#x2019;s life, but at a certain point it seems to be the only one we have. Mortality is not kind, and do not let anyone tell you it is. If there is such a thing as wisdom, and I have serious doubts about its presence in my own life, it lies in the acceptance of the human condition and perhaps the knowledge that those who have passed on are still with us, out there in the mist, showing us the way, sometimes uttering a word of caution from the shadows, sometimes visiting us in our sleep, as bright as a candle burning inside a basement that has no windows.<br> <br>On a winter morning, among white clouds of fog out at Spanish Lake, I would see the boys in butternut splashing their way through the flooded cypress, their muskets held above their heads, their equipment tied with rags so it wouldn&#x2019;t rattle. I was standing no more than ten feet from them, although they took no notice of me, as though they knew I had not been born yet, and their travail and sacrifice were not mine to bear.<br> <br>Their faces were lean from privation, as pale as wax, their hair uncut, the rents in their uniforms stitched clumsily with string. Their mouths were pinched, their eyes luminous with caution. The youngest soldier, a drummer boy, could not have been older than twelve. On one occasion I stepped into the water to join them. Even then, none acknowledged my presence. The drummer boy stumbled and couldn&#x2019;t right himself, struggling with the leather strap around his neck and the weight of his drum. I reached out to help him and felt my hand and arm sink through his shoulder. A shaft of sunlight pierced the canopy, turning the fog into white silk; in less than a second the column was gone.<br> <br>Long ago, I ceased trying to explain events such as these to either myself or others. Like many my age, I believe people in groups are to be feared and that arguing with others is folly and the knowledge of one generation cannot be passed down to the next. Those may seem cynical sentiments, but there are certain truths you keep inside you and do not defend lest you cheapen and then lose them altogether. Those truths have less to do with the dead than the awareness that we are no different from them, that they are still with us and we are still with them, and there is no afterlife but only one life, a continuum in which all time occurs at once, like a dream inside the mind of God.<br> <br>Why should an old man thrice widowed dwell on things that are not demonstrable and have nothing to do with a reasonable view of the world? Because only yesterday, on a broken sidewalk in a shabby neighborhood at the bottom of St. Claude Avenue, in the Lower Ninth Ward of St. Bernard Parish, under a colonnade that was still twisted out of shape by Katrina, across from a liquor store with barred windows that stood under a live oak probably two hundred years old, I saw a platoon of Confederate infantry march out of a field to the tune of &#x201c;Darling Nelly Gray&#x201d; and disappear through the wall of a gutted building and not exit on the other side.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>THE MAN I came to see was Fat Tony Nemo, also known as Tony the Nose, Tony Squid, or Tony Nine Ball, the latter not because he was a pool shark but because he packed a nine ball into a bartender&#x2019;s mouth with the butt of a pool cue. Of course, that was during his earlier incarnation, when he was a collector for Didoni Giacano and the two of them used to drive around New Orleans in Didi&#x2019;s Caddy convertible, terrifying whoever couldn&#x2019;t make the weekly vig, a bloodstained baseball bat propped up in the backseat. Currently, Fat Tony was involved in politics and narcotics and porn and casinos and Hollywood movies and the concrete business. He had also laundered money for the Triads in Hong Kong and helped Somoza&#x2019;s greaseballs introduce crack cocaine to America&#x2019;s inner cities. In terms of territory, he had fingers in pies all over Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. If he had any sense of morality or fear about a judgment down the track, I never saw it.<br> <br>So why would a semi-retired sheriff&#x2019;s detective from Iberia Parish want to make a social call on a psychopath like Tony Squid? Simple. Most investigative cops, often without knowing who Niccol� Machiavelli was, adhere to his admonition to keep your friends close but your enemies closer. Less simple is the fact that we share much of the same culture as the lowlifes, and we are more alike than different, and the information they give us is indispensable.<br> <br>Fat Tony was sitting in a swivel chair behind his desk when I entered his office. No, that&#x2019;s not correct. Tony didn&#x2019;t sit; he piled himself into a chair or on a couch like a gelatinous heap of whale sperm thrown on a beach, except he was wearing a blue suit with a red boutonniere in the lapel. A sword with a scrolled brass guard in a plain metal scabbard lay across his ink pad. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you could come, Dave. You never disappoint. That&#x2019;s why I like you,&#x201d; he wheezed.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the haps, Tony?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on an oxygen bottle. I&#x2019;m scheduled for a colostomy. I couldn&#x2019;t get laid in a whorehouse that has an ATM. My wife tells me I got a serious case of GAPO. Otherwise, I&#x2019;m doing great. What kind of question is that?&#x201d; He had to catch his breath before he could continue. &#x201c;Want a drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks. What&#x2019;s GAPO?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gorilla armpit odor. You still on the wagon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still in A.A., if that&#x2019;s what you mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The same thing, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever. Take Clete Purcel to a meeting with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Clete done?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What hasn&#x2019;t he done? He&#x2019;s a fucking cancer on the whole city. He should have a steel codpiece locked on his body so he can&#x2019;t reproduce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I help you, Tony?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe I can help you. I heard about your wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I appreciate your concern. I need to get back to New Iberia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She got killed in an accident?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;What, about three months ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two years. She was T-boned by a guy in a pickup. I&#x2019;d rather talk about something else.&#x201d;<br> <br>He handed me the sword. &#x201c;I got this at a flea market in Memphis. I asked an expert what it&#x2019;s worth. He said he&#x2019;d take if off my hands for three thousand. The real value, what is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know about history, what the names of these places on the hilt mean, whether those places make the sword more valuable. What&#x2019;s this Cemetery Hill stuff? Who fights a war in a fucking cemetery?&#x201d;<br> <br>The brass on the handle was engraved with the name of Lieutenant Robert S. Broussard, Eighth Louisiana Infantry. The base of the blade was stamped with the initials CSA and the name of the maker, James Conning, of Mobile, Alabama, and the year 1861.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did some Googling,&#x201d; Tony said. &#x201c;The guy who owned this was from New Iberia. It&#x2019;s worth a lot more than two or three thousand dollars, right? Maybe the guy was famous for something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t find any of that on the Internet, with all the Civil War junk that&#x2019;s on sale?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t trust the Internet. It&#x2019;s full of crazoids.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t begin to sort through the contradictions in what he had just said. This was a typical Fat Tony conversation. Trying to get inside his mind was akin to submerging your hand in an unflushed toilet. Outside, some black kids were breaking bottles with an air rifle in a vacant lot. There were concrete foundations in the lot without structures on them. A garbage truck was driving down a street, seagulls picking at its overflow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this about Clete?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got no problem with Purcel. Other people do. It&#x2019;s true he took out that fat dick of his at the Southern Yacht Club and hosed down Bobby Earl&#x2019;s car?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks ago he did it again. At the casino.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Clete did?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the pope. Earl put his lady friend in the car, and suddenly, she&#x2019;s sitting in a puddle of piss.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you show me this sword, Tony?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because the family of the guy who owned it lives in New Iberia. I thought maybe they&#x2019;d want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does any of this have to do with Clete and Bobby Earl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>My head was throbbing. &#x201c;It was good seeing you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit down. I know what happened with your wife. No witnesses except the guy who killed her. He says she ran the Stop sign. They had to cut her out with the Jaws of Life?&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel blood veins tightening on the side of my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;She died on the way to the hospital and got blamed for her own death?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who told you this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some cops. You got a dirty deal. Something ought to be done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to disengage, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On top of it, I heard the guy tried to pump the insurance company. Shut the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>I leaned forward. &#x201c;Listen carefully, Tony. My wife&#x2019;s death is my business. You stay out of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mabel, shut the door!&#x201d; he yelled at his secretary. I raised my finger at him. I was trembling. I heard the door click shut behind me. He spoke before I could. &#x201c;Hear me out. The guy ran over a kid in a school zone in Alabama. The kid was crippled for life. You give me the nod, this guy is gonna be crawling around on stumps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When did he run over a child in a school zone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten, fifteen years back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where in Alabama?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What difference does it make? I&#x2019;m telling you like it is. A guy like that has got it coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was like every gangster I ever knew. They&#x2019;re self-righteous and marginalize their victims before breaking their bones. Not one of them could think his way out of a wet paper bag. Their level of cruelty is equaled only by the level of disingenuousness that governs their lives.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to get this straight, Tony. Go near the man who hit my wife&#x2019;s car, and I&#x2019;ll come looking for you, up close and personal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; He lit a cigarette with a paper match, cupping the flame. He threw the burnt match into the wastebasket. &#x201c;So fuck me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood up and pulled the sword halfway from its scabbard, then slid it inside again. The guard was brass, molded like a metal basket with slits in it. It was incised with the names of three battles that took place during Stonewall Jackson&#x2019;s Shenandoah campaign, plus Cemetery Hill at Gettysburg, and extended protectively and cuplike over the back of my hand. The black leather on the grip was both soft and firm, wrapped with gold wire. I replaced the sword on Tony&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;I think the Broussard family would be honored and delighted if you gave this to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having a hard time processing this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I try to be your friend, and you&#x2019;re offended and make threats. If you were somebody else, we&#x2019;d have a different outcome here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So fuck both of us. Tell me something, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? How you should get rid of terminal assholitis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you keep your office in a neighborhood like this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks like a moonscape. In the next storm, it&#x2019;s going underwater again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like to stay close to the people. On that subject, I&#x2019;m backing a guy who might end up president of the United States. Want to know who that is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jimmy Nightingale. People have been talking political correctness in this country for too many years. There&#x2019;s gonna be a change. Fucking A.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Somehow I believe you, Tony.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that was probably the most depressing thought I&#x2019;d had in a long time.</p><h2>Halo: Fractures: Extraordinary Tales from the Halo Canon</h2><p>A sensational short story collection in the expansive universe of HALO, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series!<br><br>Launch once more into galaxy-spanning conflict and legendary heroism...shards of an ever-expanding journey where human and alien alike find their finest hours in facing their greatest challenges.

He is a native of Georgia and began his writing career in the advertising industry. <i>Chiefs</i>, his debut in 1981, won the Edgar Award. An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New Mexico.1<br><br> Stone Barrington lay back in the cockpit of the Concordia 40, a small cruising yawl built by Abeking &amp; Rasmussen, a German yard, in 1938, and let the light breeze take him back toward Dark Harbor. The sails were nicely balanced as he sailed up Maine's Penobscot Bay, and he lashed the helm while he looked around, then peed overboard. Thus relieved, he settled back into the cockpit and tucked a cushion behind him, relaxed and happy.<br><br> He dozed off.<br><br> The yacht jerked a bit, waking him, and he found himself in the thickest fog he had ever experienced. He could barely make out the stem of the boat, and he was uncertain about his course. He had been headed for the Tarratine Yacht Club moorings, and his own dock beyond, but he didn't know how long he had been asleep or whether the wind had changed and put him off course. He checked the depth sounder: 55 feet of water-too deep to anchor with the rode he had aboard. He stood up and dropped the mainsail to slow the boat to a crawl, continuing with the jib and the mizzen. He went back to his cockpit seat and resumed his position, but left the helm lashed. They were making only three knots in the light breeze, and he reckoned he couldn't get into too much trouble at that speed. The depth was now 70 feet.<br><br> He heard a voice from somewhere in the fog saying, "Start the engines and drop the sails," but he couldn't figure out the direction from which it had come. Then there was the sound of water moving past a hull, but he was still unable to determine the direction. He rummaged in a cockpit locker for the air horn and pressed the button. The noise shocked him, and it was followed by shouting from the fog.<br><br> Then he saw a shape to port and grabbed for the helm. It took a moment to throw off the lashings, and in that time there was a terrible noise, and his world turned upside down. The boom swung across the cockpit and caught him on the side of his head, and darkness fell.<br><br> He felt the pain before he felt his surroundings, and he feared that if he opened his eyes it might make things worse. He allowed some light past his eyelids, then quickly shut them again, groaning loudly at the pain. He heard a rustle beside him, and felt a cool hand on his forehead.<br><br> "He's awake," a low female voice said. "Get Father."<br><br> Stone tried to speak, but his mouth was too dry. A glass brushed his lips, and he took in a sip of water.<br><br> "Is that better? Can you speak?"<br><br> "I'm sorry to open with a clich&#x17d;," he said, "but where am I?"<br><br> She chuckled. "You're in bed. You had an accident."<br><br> He got his eyes all the way open this time, and there was an arm attached to the cool hand, and a woman attached to the other end of the arm-very blond, almost white hair. "What kind of an accident?"<br><br> "What's the last thing you remember?" she asked.<br><br> He thought about that. "Fog," he said. "Lots of fog. There was a noise."<br><br> "Your foghorn?"<br><br> "Yes."<br><br> "That was the first we knew of your presence."<br><br> "I didn't hear yours."<br><br> "I'm sorry about that. The crew was busy getting the sails down."<br><br> He struggled to sit up, but she pushed him back. "Not yet," she said. She lifted his head and tucked another pillow under it, enabling him to look around-first, at the woman. Very nice. He was in a cozy cabin of beautifully varnished mahogany.<br><br> "My father will be here in a moment to take a look at you," she said. "Your name is Stone Barrington, is it not?"<br><br> "It is."<br><br> "My name is Marisa Carlsson, with a cee and two esses."<br><br> "How did you know my name?"<br><br> "You had a wallet with business cards inside. It's drying out, while your clothes are being laundered."<br><br> He realized he was naked under the covers. "Who undressed me?" he asked.<br><br> She laughed. "The pleasure was mine."<br><br> "I'm glad you see it that way."<br><br> "Well," a man's voice said, "is our patient awake?" He stepped into the cabin, an older male version of his daughter.<br><br> "More or less," Stone said.<br><br> "This is my father, Dr. Paul Carlsson," she said.<br><br> "You've had a thump on your head," the doctor said.<br><br> "I noticed that."<br><br> Carlsson laughed. "He's well enough to have a sense of humor."<br><br> "Where is my boat?" Stone asked.<br><br> "I'm afraid it's at the bottom of Penobscot Bay. There was nothing we could do-it sank very quickly after the collision."<br><br> "I'm sorry to hear it. It was an old boat that had made people happy for a long time."<br><br> "What boat was it?"<br><br> "A Concordia 40 yawl, built in 1938, at Abeking and Rasmussen."<br><br> "Funny, that's where this yacht was built," the doctor said.<br><br> "What is she?"<br><br> "A ninety-foot ketch, designed by Ron Holland, built the year before last."<br><br> "Well, I suppose the better yacht won the battle."<br><br> "Don't worry about your boat, we'll deal with that later. You've had a concussion, but your vital signs are strong and you're making good conversation, so I don't think we'll have to hospitalize you. We'll get you some soup, to keep your strength up, but then you must rest. You should be fine in the morning."<br><br> A uniformed steward came in with a steaming mug of something on a tray. Stone sipped it. "Chicken soup," he said.<br><br> "The cure for everything," the doctor replied.<br><br> "Except my headache. Do you have any aspirin?"<br><br> "We do. Marisa?"<br><br> She left the cabin and returned with three pills. Stone washed them down with the soup. "One of them will help you sleep."<br><br> The next time he woke up sun was streaming through the port over his head, and his clothes, laundered and ironed, were neatly stacked on the bed. He found a razor and a new toothbrush in the head, then had a hot shower and dressed. He stepped out of his cabin into a hallway and followed that to the saloon, then he walked up some stairs to the deck and found Dr. Carlsson and his daughter having breakfast on the afterdeck.<br><br> They waved him to a seat, and the steward took his order.<br><br> "How are you feeling?" Carlsson asked.<br><br> "Almost like new-perhaps a little fuzzy around the edges."<br><br> "That's the last of your sleeping pill."<br><br> Stone looked around; they were anchored in the harbor not far from the Tarratine. "I live right over there," he said, pointing at his house. "Just down from the yacht club."<br><br> "What a lovely house," Marisa said. "Is it old?"<br><br> "Only a few years. I inherited it from a cousin, Dick Stone, who built it."<br><br> "We'll get you ashore after breakfast," Carlsson said, "and then we'll talk about your yacht, see what we can do."<br><br> "Are there just the two of you aboard?" Stone asked.<br><br> "Yes, my wife died some years ago," Carlsson said.<br><br> "Why don't you come for dinner this evening?" Stone asked.<br><br> "That's very kind of you," Carlsson said. "We'd like that very much."<br><br> "Are you Dr. Carlsson of the Carlsson Clinic?" Stone asked.<br><br> "I am one of the Dr. Carlssons," he replied, "the elder one. Marisa and my two sons are all Dr. Carlssons, as well."<br><br> The Carlsson Clinic was a famous hospital, with locations in several cities, on a par with the Mayo Clinic. "Well," Stone said, "I have not lacked for medical attention. If you say I'm all right, then I must be."<br><br> 2<br><br> The tender from the big yacht dropped Stone at his dock, and he walked up to the house. The door opened, and Bob, his yellow Labrador retriever, bounded out to greet him, carrying a ratty stuffed raccoon that was his favorite toy.<br><br> Stone knelt and petted him, scratched his back, then took the raccoon and tossed it into the house. Bob followed closely.<br><br> Mary, his housekeeper, was dusting the living room. "We were worried," she said, "when you didn't come home last night."<br><br> "I had an accident," Stone said.<br><br> Mary's husband, Seth Hotchkiss, came into the room. "What kind of accident?"<br><br> "I got run down by a much larger yacht in the fog."<br><br> "Any damage?"<br><br> "Total loss. She's at the bottom of the bay."<br><br> "Such a beautiful boat," Seth said. "Very sad. You all right?"<br><br> "A slight headache is all. By the way, there'll be two guests for dinner tonight. They're coming at six for drinks. Two Dr. Carlssons, father and daughter."<br><br> "Lobster?" Mary asked.<br><br> "Just fine." She would boiled it, shelled it, and tossed the meat in butter.<br><br> "Mr. Rawls moved out and into his place this morning," Seth said. "I drove the stuff he'd bought over there."<br><br> Stone's neighbor, Ed Rawls, had had his house destroyed by fire a couple of months ago and had rebuilt. "I'm happy for him," he said.<br><br> "Joan called already this morning."<br><br> "I'll call her back now." He sat down on the sofa and picked up the phone.<br><br> "The Barrington Practice at Woodman &amp; Weld."<br><br> "I'm alive."<br><br> "Mary said you didn't come home last night. Anybody I know?"<br><br> "An accident-collision with a much larger yacht. I lost the boat."<br><br> "Ooh! I'll keep my picture of it as a memento."<br><br> "Anything going on?"<br><br> "You're still getting calls about the business with Christian St. Clair and Nelson Knott. What should I tell them?"<br><br> Christian St. Clair was a multibillionaire who had been running a TV pitchman, Nelson Knott, for President, putting lots of money behind him.<br><br> "Tell them they're both dead, and I don't speak for them. Tell them to call that guy, what's his name?"<br><br> "Erik Macher."<br><br> "That's the one. He was St. Clair's right-hand man in all this. They should speak to him, if he hasn't been arrested."<br><br> "It's been weeks. Why don't they leave you alone?"<br><br> "Beats me. If I talk to the media I'll find myself in the spin zone-they'll distort whatever I say."<br><br> "This morning's Times had the medical examiner's report on St. Clair. Cause of death was a bomb in a piece of luggage that he opened. Would that be your strong case?"<br><br> "Not my strong case, Ed Rawls's. It was taken from him at gunpoint, and he didn't have time to tell them how to open it safely."<br><br> "So Ed's not to blame?"<br><br> "I would defend him on the available evidence."<br><br> "When are you coming home? You're due for your physical first of the week."<br><br> "I'm dining with two eminent physicians tonight. Will that do?"<br><br> "It's your FAA flight physical, to keep your medical certificate valid. You can't fly without it."<br><br> "I know, I know. I hate to come back just for that. The weather up here is gorgeous-autumn comes earlier here than in New York."<br><br> "Lucky you. It's like a steam bath on the streets here."<br><br> "No calls?"<br><br> "Dino called to find out when you're coming back. He couldn't reach you there."<br><br> "I'll call him this morning. Nothing else?"<br><br> "Nope. Apparently everyone has forgotten about you."<br><br> "Everyone but the bloody media. Don't give them this number or my cell number."<br><br> "Gotcha."<br><br> "See you later." Stone hung up and wondered what to do next. He and his clothes were already clean, so he didn't need to bathe and dress. He called Dino.<br><br> "Bacchetti."<br><br> "It's Stone."<br><br> "Where the hell have you been?"<br><br> "I'll tell you, but you're not going to believe me."<br><br> "Try me."<br><br> "I was sailing late yesterday afternoon, when I encountered a fog bank-couldn't see a thing."<br><br> "Let me guess-you were run down by a beautiful yacht sailed by a beautiful woman who rescued you and nursed you back to health."<br><br> "That's pretty much what happened."<br><br> "You're kidding. I made that up."<br><br> "You must be psychic. The owner of the yacht is Dr. Paul Carlsson, of the Carlsson Clinic-and his daughter."<br><br> "What happened to your yacht?"<br><br> "She lies in a watery grave at the bottom of Penobscot Bay."<br><br> "That's sad-pretty boat."<br><br> "Listen, can you still hijack that police helicopter whenever you like?"<br><br> "Whenever I like, sometimes."<br><br> "Why don't you do that this afternoon and get them to drop you here? Weekend's coming up, and it's nice and cool here."<br><br> "Put me down for a yes. I'll check with Viv and confirm, if you'll hang on for a moment." He put Stone on hold, then came back. "I talked her into it, and the chopper's available. We'll aim for five o'clock."<br><br> "I'll meet you at the airstrip. The Carlssons are coming to dinner. They're nice folks."<br><br> "We'll look forward to it. Bye." Dino hung up.<br><br> Stone told Mary to order more lobsters.<br><br> Stone stood by the lovely old 1938 Ford station wagon that was the house car and watched the NYPD helicopter settle onto the runway. The copilot got out and dumped the Bacchettis� luggage onto the tarmac, then got back in and the chopper lifted off and turned southwest, toward New York.<br><br> Stone kissed Viv, shook Dino's hand, and the three of them loaded the bags into the wagon. As they drove away, another helicopter, one Stone recognized from a charter service at Rockland airport, set down on the runway. He didn't see who got out.<br><br> "I hear Paul Carlsson is coming to dinner," Viv said. "I met him at some event last year. He was charming, and he has a charming daughter, too."<br><br> "They're both coming," Stone said.<br><br> "It's about time. You've been without female companionship for too long."<br><br> "You're not going to get an argument from me about that."<br><br> 3<br><br> Erik Macher marched himself into the late Christian St. Clair's library/office, which was undergoing the final touches of repair, and sat down at a leather-topped library table already occupied by four serious-looking men.<br><br> "Good morning, gentlemen," Macher said, careful to speak respectfully.<br><br> The four nodded and mumbled something. They were the chairman of the board, two directors, and the corporate counsel of St. Clair Enterprises, and Macher was there to let them know, as gently as possible, that he would be running things from now on. Their agreement was crucial to him.<br><br> "I assume you all received the documents I sent you."<br><br> They all nodded.<br><br> "And I assume you read Mr. St. Clair's will, which was prepared by the law firm of Mr. Berenson, our corporate counsel."<br><br> "That is so," Berenson said, "and it was signed and witnessed in my presence." The others merely nodded.<br><br> "Mr. Berenson, was I a party to drawing up the will, and did I discuss it at any time with you or any of your people?"<br><br> "No, and no," Berenson replied. "I am satisfied that the will is authentic and correctly represents the wishes of Mr. St. Clair."<br><br> "Thank you," Macher said. "Do any of you have any questions about the preparation and intent of the will?"</p><h2>Mabel Bunny &amp; Co.: 15 Loveable Animals to Crochet Using Chunky Yarn</h2><p><b>Crochet the most adorable animals in cosy, chunky yarn.

And the more you get to know Jesus, the more you&#x2019;ll discover that this can be your life too. </em></p><p><em>Easter Love Letters from God</em>, written by Glenys Nellist and illustrated by Sophie Allsopp, guides children and families through Holy Week with seven beautifully illustrated Bible stories. Following each story the child will find his or her own letter from God. Children will love the excitement of opening the letters and parents will love how the letters elaborate on the Bible stories being told. Each message gives the child a sense of wonder as they discover what happened leading up to Jesus&#x2019; resurrection on Easter Sunday. A very special Bible verse, entitled God&#x2019;s Wonderful Words to You will accompany each story and letter. Much more than a memory verse, each carefully chosen promise will be God&#x2019;s very own personal words of love, encouragement, and hope.</p></p><p>Glenys Nellist was born and raised in a little village in northern England.

In the early years of my academic career, Richard Muller's dictionary was the very first to attain such esteemed status. Not only is it a repository of information impossible to find so quickly anywhere else, it is just a darn good read. It's a primer of Latin syntax and at the same time a sophisticated introduction to careful theology. It's a thrill to see it newly improved, some thirty years later! Serious students of Latin, serious students of theology, and--frankly--serious students of clear thought will be in Richard's debt for another generation to come. Well done!"<br>--<b>John&nbsp;L. Thompson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"If one of the most well-read theologians of his generation presents a dictionary, one has high expectations, and Richard Muller does not disappoint! Besides more common terms, one also finds here lucid explanations of rarer scholastic expressions, so that even the specialist will learn and profit from this book. This is a must-have for students and professors and for everybody who studies the Christian tradition."<br>--<b>Ulrich&nbsp;L. Lehner</b>, Marquette University<br><br>"Few theological resources offer as much insight and useful information as Muller's dictionary. I regularly encourage my students to buy this book and read it cover to cover! This is more than a reference occasionally to be consulted; it is a key to unlocking the riches of classic Reformed theology. I highly recommend this book to students, pastors, and scholars--to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the historic Protestant faith."<br>--<b>J.&nbsp;V.

Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

When Drizzt and his companions leave Mithral Hall in search of Wulfgar, they find themselves on the trail of the warhammer as well, a trail that will lead them to a startling reunion, and the last battle for the heart and soul of Wulfgar.</p><p>R.A. Salvatore has spent so many years winding himself into fantasy worlds that he's still tyring to figure out how to unwind. He is the author of more than forty novels and more than a dozen <i>New York Times</i> best sellers, including <i>The Two Swords</i>, which debuted at or near the top of many best seller lists.Elf ranger Drizzt Do'Urden and his gifted warriors go in search of a missing member of their own band in this latest fast-moving fantasy adventure from bestseller Salvatore (Servant of the Shard, etc.). In the previous episode of the Paths of Darkness series (of the Forgotten Realms umbrella series), Wulfgar the barbarian fought a demon, was possessed and supposedly killed. Now it turns out that not only is he alive but he is in need of the type of assistance at which his friends excel. Getting to Wulfgar and aiding him in his quest for Aegis-fang, his warhammer, is only part of the fun. Drizzt Do'Urden, along with Cattie-Brie, a dwarf named Bruenor Battlehammer and Regis the Halfling, often have to battle the obligatory orcs, goblins and ogres on their way to the real business at hand. A second plot involves the stalking of Drizzt Do'Urden by Le'Lorinel, a Moon elf (or pale elf, whereas Drizzt is a Drow or dark elf). The author combines some of the good versus evil of Robin Hood and his merry men, the campy heroics and friendship of The Princess Bride (including an appearance of dread pirate Sheila Kree) and a rather unfulfilled stab at race relations with Le'Lorinel's unhinged hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden. As this is the fourth novel in the subseries of a larger series, it is not for the uninitiated. Long-awaited by Salvatore's legions of fans, however, this book is as certain as its predecessors to climb bestseller charts. 10-city author tour. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Golden Lake</h2><p>Lyssa's unique ability to access detailed galactic history brings a deep sense of cosmic family, bridging the vastness of space and into the human experience.<p></p> <p>- Jamye Price, author of <i>Opening to Light Language</i></p> <p>This profound material encourages humanity to choose to go through the process of awakening instead of allowing self-destruction.

In this book a noted archeologist and anthropologist tells the story of the Tainos from their ancestral days on the South American continent to their rapid decline after contact with the Spanish explorers.&nbsp;Drawing on archeological and ethno-historical evidence, Irving Rouse sketches a picture of the Tainos as they existed during the time of Columbus, contrasting their customs with those of their neighbors. He then moves backward in time to the ancestors of the Tainos&#x2015;two successive groups who settled the West Indies and who are known to archeologists as the Saladoid peoples and the Ostionoid peoples. By reconstructing the development of these groups and studying their interaction with other groups during the centuries before Columbus, Rouse shows precisely who the Tainos were. He vividly recounts Columbus's four voyages, the events of the European contact, and the early Spanish views of the Tainos, particularly their art and religion. The narration shows that the Tainos did not long survive the advent of Columbus. Weakened by forced labor, malnutrition, and diseases introduced by the foreigners, and dispersed by migration and intermarriage, they ceased to exist as a separate population group. As Rouse discusses the Tainos' contributions to the Spaniards&#x2015;from Indian corn, tobacco, and rubber balls to art, artifacts, and new words&#x2015;we realize that their effect on Western civilization, brief through their contact, was an important and lasting one.</p><p><b>Irving Rouse</b> is Charles J. MacCurdy Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University and Curator Emeritus of Anthropology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University.<br><p>"A model of clarity and lightly worn erudition, and it contains the best and most straightforward description of the four Columbus voyages and their implications for the Amerindians I have seen. . . . Columbus had found large, permanent villages of Tainos Indians in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, each governed by a chief or <i>cacique,</i> and each containing an average of two thousand people.

The first is to occur in his twentieth year, the last in his thirtieth. What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five critical days? What challenges must he survive? The path he follows will defy every expectation and will take all the love, humor, and courage he possesses. For who Jimmy Tock is and what he must accomplish on the five days his world turns is a mystery both dangerous and wondrous.</p><p>With his bestselling blend of nail-biting intensity, daring artistry, and storytelling magic, Dean Koontz returns with an emotional roller coaster of a tale filled with enough twists, turns, shocks, and surprises for ten ordinary novels. Here is the story of five days in the life of an ordinary man born to an extraordinary legacy--a story that will challenge the way you look at good and evil, life and death, and everything in between.<p>Jimmy Tock comes into the world on the very night his grandfather leaves it. As a violent storm rages outside the hospital, Rudy Tock spends long hours walking the corridors between the expectant fathers' waiting room and his dying father's bedside. It's a strange vigil made all the stranger when, at the very height of the storm's fury, Josef Tock suddenly sits up in bed and speaks coherently for the frist and last time since his stroke.</p><p>What he says before he dies is that there will be five dark days in the life of his grandson--five dates whose terrible events Jimmy will have to prepare himself to face. The first is to occur in his twentieth year; the second in his twent-third year; the third in his twenty-eighth; the fourth in his twenty-ninth; the fifth in his thirtieth.</p><p>Rudy is all too ready to discount his father's last words as a dying man's delusional rambling. But then he discovers that Josef also predicted the time of his grandson's birth to the minute, as well as his <i>exact</i> height and weight, and the fact that Jimmy would be born with syndactyly--the unexplained anomal of fused digits--on his left foot. Suddenly the old man's predictions take on a chilling significance.</p><p>What terrifying events await Jimmy on these five dark days? What nightmares will he face? What challenges must he survive? As the novel unfolds, picking up Jimmy's story at each of these crisis points, the path he must follow will defy every expectation. And with each crisis he faces, he will move closer to a fate he could never have imagined. For who Jimmy Tock is and what he must accomplish on the five days when his world turns is a mystery as dangerous as it is wondrous--a struggle against an evil so dark and pervasive, only the most extraordinary of human spirits can shine through.</p><p><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><b>Dean Koontz, </b>the author of many #1<i> New York Times </i>bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Anna, and the enduring spirit of their golden, Trixie.</p><h2>Trim Carpentry (For Pros By Pros)</h2><p><p>Trim carpentry requires attention to minute detail, the right tools, and a good amount of patience and care.

Its dramatic story is one of bloodshed and peace, corruption and purity. Here Dr. Hurlbut retells this story in an objective, concise, and clear style, emphasizing the spirit of the church, its growth and maturation, and the causes leading to historic events and their resulting influence. Accurate, up-to-date, and vividly presented, Hurlbut's Story of the Christian Church traces the six general periods of church history from A.D. 30 to the present day. A concluding section, covering the period since Dr. Hurlbut's death, has been added in this revised edition, thus giving the reader a complete, easily understood overview of the Christian church. Designed for two audiences, this book contains outlines and references in the margins to aid the student or teacher along with a continuous narrative and numerous illustrations for the general reader.

And if it is so useful, why didn&#x2019;t it evolve in other animals? This groundbreaking account of the evolution of reason by two renowned cognitive scientists seeks to solve this double enigma.

Rarely has this insight seemed more relevant than it does right now. Still, an essential puzzle remains: How did we come to be this way? In <i>The Enigma of Reason</i>, the cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber take a stab at answering this question... [Their] argument runs, more or less, as follows: Humans&#x2019; biggest advantage over other species is our ability to cooperate. Cooperation is difficult to establish and almost as difficult to sustain. For any individual, freeloading is always the best course of action.

Some have argued for modules specialized for reasoning about particular topics. But Mercier and Sperber argue for a single module that can frame an argument and its conclusion: the former aids cooperation and the latter communication. So, the ultimate goal of reasoning is persuasion. It&#x2019;s an extraordinarily ambitious theory presented with brilliant insights, profound scholarship, and entertaining anecdotes.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philip Johnson-Laird, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a terrific book.

(Marjorie Zatz <i>Arizona State University</i>)<br><br>"The best textbooks identify critical issues in the field and then provide thought-provoking, evidence-based studies that ground the issues in what we know.

Students are exposed to some of the best thinking and research produced by scholars with diverse ideas on how to prevent and control crime in our society." (John Hagan <i>Northwestern University</i>)<br><br>"Criminal justice represents the biggest clash between noble ideals and raging inequalities in the social world. As students learn the rules of the game and its key players&#x2015;police, courts, and corrections&#x2015;they should also understand how the system can simultaneously serve the cause of justice and lead to injustices.

There are two ways of waking up in the morning. One is to say, &#x201c;Good morning, God,&#x201d; and the other is to say, &#x201c;Good God, morning!&#x201d; We are going to start with the second.</p><p>People who wake up that way have an anxiety about life. Life seems rather absurd to them, and considerable literature is being produced today on the absurdity of life. One of the best expressions of that absurdity is a novel with two factories, on either side of a river. One factory took great big stones, smashed and ground them into powder, and shipped the powder to the other side of the river, where the other factory turned them into great big boulders. Then the boulders were sent back to the first factory and so the routine continued. This is a literary expression of the way people regard life today.</p><p>One finds this absurdity expressed in a play by an existentialist who pictured three people in hell. Each one wanted to talk about himself, his own aches and his own pains. The others were only interested in their own aches and pains. Finally, when the curtain goes down, the last line is &#x201c;My neighbor is hell!&#x201d; which is the way some people live. Along with this sense of absurdity there is also a drift. Many minds are like Old Man River; they just keep floating along, no goal, just a kind of an arrow without a target, pilgrims without a shrine, journeys at sea without any kind of a port. What is the common conclusion of people who wake up and say, &#x201c;Good God, morning&#x201d;? To them, life has no meaning; it is without purpose, goal, or destiny.</p><p>I remember when I first went to Europe to study as a young priest. I was taking courses during the summer at the Sorbonne in Paris, principally in order to learn French. I dwelled in a boardinghouse that belonged to Madame Citro�n. I was there about a week when she came to me and said something, but it was all French to me. You get so angry in Paris because the dogs and horses understand French, and you don&#x2019;t! There were three American schoolteachers living in the boardinghouse, and I asked them to act as interpreters. This is the story that came out.</p><p>Madame Citro�n said after her marriage, her husband left her, and a daughter that was born to them became a moral wreck on the streets of Paris. Then she pulled out of her pocket a small vial of poison.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;I do not believe in God, and if there is one, I curse Him. I&#x2019;ve decided since life has no meaning and is absurd, to take this poison tonight. Can you do anything for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Through the interpreter I said, &#x201c;I can if you&#x2019;re going to take that stuff!&#x201d;<br><br>I asked her to postpone her suicide for nine days. I think it is the only case on record of a woman postponing suicide for nine days. I never prayed before as I prayed for that woman. On the ninth day the good Lord gave her great grace. Some years later on the way to Lourdes, I stopped off in the city of Dax, where I enjoyed the hospitality of Monsieur, Madame, and Mademoiselle Citro�n.</p><p>I said to the village priest, &#x201c;Are the Citro�ns good Catholics?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s wonderful when people keep the faith all during their lives.&#x201d;</p><p>Obviously, he did not know the story. So it&#x2019;s possible to find one&#x2019;s way out of this absurdity.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s come to a question which interests all psychiatrists and all of us, &#x201c;What is the difference between a normal and an abnormal person?&#x201d; A normal person always works toward a goal or purpose; the abnormal person looks for escape mechanisms, excuses, and rationalizations to avoid discovering the meaning and purpose of life. The normal person sets for himself a goal. A young man may want to be a doctor or a lawyer, but beyond that there is something else.</p><p>Suppose you ask, &#x201c;What do you want to do after you become a doctor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well. I want to marry and raise children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be happy and make money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give money to my children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then?&#x201d;</p><p>There comes a last &#x201c;And then?&#x201d; The normal person knows what that &#x201c;and then&#x201d; is. The abnormal person is locked up within the barrel of his own ego. He&#x2019;s like an egg that&#x2019;s never been hatched. He refuses to submit himself to divine incubation in order to arrive at a different life than he has.</p><p>What are some of the escape mechanisms of the abnormal person? If he wants to go from New York to Washington, he isn&#x2019;t concerned about Washington; he&#x2019;s concerned about giving excuses why he doesn&#x2019;t go to Washington. A common escape mechanism for the abnormal person is a love of speed. I believe that an excessive love of speed or, should I say, a love of excessive speed, is due to the want of a goal or purpose in life. So they do not know where they are going, but they certainly are on their way! There may even be an unconscious, or half-conscious, desire to end life because it is without purpose. Another escape can be sex, as well as throwing oneself into business in an abnormal kind of way in order to have the intensity of an experience atone for a want of goal or purpose.</p><p>One very famous psychiatrist, Dr. Carl Jung, said that after twenty-five years of experiences dealing with mental patients, at least one-third of his patients had no observable clinical neurosis. All of them were suffering from a want of the meaning and purpose of life, and not until they discovered that would they ever be happy. The vast majority of people today are suffering from what might be called an existential neurosis, the anxiety and the problem of living. They ask, &#x201c;What is it all about?&#x201d; &#x201c;Where do I go from here?&#x201d; &#x201c;How do I find it?&#x201d;</p><p>You may be thinking, now I&#x2019;m going to tell you to get down on your knees and pray to God. No, I&#x2019;m not. I may say that a little later, because people who have an existential neurosis are too far away from that for the moment. I&#x2019;m offering two solutions: the first, go out and help your neighbor. Those who suffer from an anxiety of life live only for themselves. Their minds and hearts have been dammed up. All of the scum of the river of life makes the heart and mind a kind of a garbage heap, and the easiest way out is to love people whom you see. If we do not love those whom we see, how can we love God, whom we do not see? Visit the sick. Be kind to the poor. Help the healing of lepers. Find your neighbor, and a neighbor is someone in need. Once you do this, you begin to break out of the shell. You discover that your neighbor is not hell, as Sartre says, your neighbor is part of yourself and is a creature of God.</p><p>A father brought his young son to me, a conceited young delinquent, who had given up his faith and was bitter with himself and everyone whom he met. Following our visit the boy ran away from home for a year. The boy came back just as bad, and the father brought him to me asking, &#x201c;What should I do with him?&#x201d; I advised him to send his son to a school outside the United States. About a year later the boy came back to see me, requesting, &#x201c;Would you be willing to give me moral support for an enterprise I have undertaken in Mexico? There is a group of boys in the college where I am who have built a little school. We have gone all around the neighborhood and brought in children to teach them catechism. We have also brought a doctor from the United States, once a year for one month, to take care of the sick people of the neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>And I asked, &#x201c;How did you become interested in this?&#x201d;</p><p>He replied, &#x201c;The boys went down there during the summer and I joined them.&#x201d;</p><p>He recovered his faith, morals, and everything else in his neighbor. It is the poor, indigent, needy, sick, fellow creatures of God, who give to us great strength. Some years ago there was an Indian who went into Tibet. He went in to do evangelizing in that non-Christian country with a Tibetan guide. During the trip they got very cold crossing the foothills of the Himalayas and sat down, exhausted and almost frozen. This Indian, whose name was Singh, said, &#x201c;I think I hear a man moaning down there in the abyss!&#x201d;</p><p>The Tibetan said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re almost dead yourself, you can&#x2019;t help him!&#x201d;</p><p>Singh said, &#x201c;Yes, I will help him.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>How to walk into church</h2><p>If you&#39;ve been a churchgoer for more than just a few Sundays, walking into church probably doesn&#39;t seem like it deserves its own &#39;how to&#39; manual. Right? In fact, it most likely seems like a pretty straightforward and trivial weekly activity. But things are rarely as simple as they seem, and how you walk into church reveals a great deal about what you think church is, what it&#39;s for, and what you think you re doing there. In How to Walk into Church, Tony Payne helps us think biblically about church. Along with giving plenty of other practical advice, he suggests a way to walk into church that beautifully expresses what church is and why you re there - a way that every Christian can master. If you go to church, this Brief Book is for you.</p><p>I do it three times every week: Every Sunday morning, every Sunday evening, and every Wednesday evening I walk into church. Sometimes I walk into church eager and full of expectation; sometimes I walk into church grudgingly and grumpy; sometimes I walk into church sick or sorrowful. But week after week I do it. And I attach very little significance to it. In the opening pages of his little book How To Walk Into Church, Tony Payne describes the common experience: I suppose it must have happened upwards of 2000 times by now. I exit the car, usually with a wife and various kids in tow, and amble in the front door, tossing off a quick greeting to whomever is handing out the folded sheets of paper that in church-speak are called bulletins . After a quick scan of the seating situation who has already parked themselves where, who I might want to avoid and so on I choose a spot not too near the front and sidle into the chosen row, smiling feebly at the person sitting on the other side of the seat that I ve politely left vacant between us. And there it is. I ve walked into church. Not exactly a taxing or impressive feat, and hardly worthy of having a book written about it, even a very short book like this. But things are rarely as simple as they seem. No, things are rarely that simple. Many of the mundane and repetitive tasks that fill our lives have outsized importance: Walking into your home at the end of a long day s work, saying goodnight to your children, participating in family devotions these are little things but significant things, just like walking into church. After all, How you walk into church will be determined by what you think church is, and what you think you re doing there. If you think church is a bit like going to the movies, you might walk in expecting to be entertained or inspired. If you think church is an opportunity for personal devotion and worship, you ll probably walk in not wanting to interact too much with anyone else. If you think church is something you have to do in order to do the right thing or stay on God s good side, you ll walk in with a determination to do what needs to be done (and then leave as soon as possible). So how should we walk into church? Here is what Payne asks you to consider: Walk into church praying about where you should sit. Yes, it is that simple. And it has that much significance. Of course, he doesn t just say that you should consider praying as you walk into church, he also proves its value. He does this first by asking and answering a pair of foundational questions: What is this thing we call church ? and Why am I walking into church? Church is God s gathering of God s people and we walk into this gathering week after week because we need mutual encouragement and exhortation. Each one of us has a role to play in church and each one of us is a necessary part of the gathering. We do not go first to be served by others, but to serve. Church is not about me. It s not about the experience I have or what I get out of it. Church is a classic opportunity to love my brothers and sisters who are there, by seeking to build them up in Christ. With the questions answered, Payne goes on to offer counsel on how to approach church and how to make the most of the experience both during and after the worship service. This is a short and simple book less than 70 pages long but one that could make a profound difference in the life and worship of your church. I would like to see it make that difference in the life of my church. If I and the other members at Grace Fellowship Church would read, understand, and implement the basic teaching of this book, I believe we would think very differently about how we walk into church and I believe we would do it --Tim Challies<br><br>This book is a great idea. It's wonderfully practical, helpful, and relevant. I hope we can give it away to our new members. Tony has given us a necessary reminder on the importance of walking into church with the right heart, the right head, and the right spirit. --Kevin DeYoung Senior Pastor, University Reformed Church (East Lansing, Michigan, USA)</p><h2>Frommer&#39;s Iceland (Complete Guides)</h2><p><p>Comprehensive and completely up-to-date, <i>Frommer&#x2019;s Iceland</i> takes you from world-famous waterfalls to hopping nightclubs and everywhere in between.

Maxwell can teach you how to turn any situation into a winning experience. </b> No one wins at everything they try. But any setback, whether professional or personal, can become a step forward with the right tools and mindset to turn loss into a gain. Drawing on nearly 50 years of leadership experience, Maxwell provides a roadmap for winning by examining the eleven elements that constitute the "DNA" of people who succeed in the face of problems, failure, and losses. Learning is not easy during down times. It takes discipline to do the right thing when something goes wrong. As John Maxwell often points out, experience itself isn't the best teacher; evaluating, understanding, and growing from your experience is. By examining how that process works, you can learn how to take risks and tackle challenges with a successful person's outlook.

Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway return to Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley more than four decades after the battle they recalled in their #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young</i>. Renewing their relationships with ten American veterans of the fabled conflict&#x2014;and with former adversaries&#x2014;the authors explore how the war changed them all, as well as their two countries. </p> <p> <i>We Are Soldiers Still</i> is an emotional journey back to hallowed ground, putting a human face on warfare as the authors reflect on war's devastating cost. </p></p><p><p>Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (USA Ret.) graduated from West Point, commanded two infantry companies in the Korean War, and was a battalion and brigade commander in Vietnam. After thirty-two years of service, he retired from the Army in 1977.</p><br><br><p>Recently retired senior military correspondent for Knight Ridder Newspapers Joseph L.

It would be a monumental task for Moore and Galloway to top their classic 1992 memoir, <i>We Were Soldiers Once... and Young</i>. But they come close in this sterling sequel, which tells the backstory of two of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles (in which Moore participated as a lieutenant colonel), their first book and a 1993 ABC-TV documentary that brought them back to the battlefield. Moore's strong first-person voice reviews the basics of the November 1965 battles, part of the 34-day Battle of the Ia Drang Valley. Among other things, Moore and Galloway (who covered the battle for UPI) offer portraits of two former enemy commanders, generals Nguyen Huu An and Chu Huy Man, whom the authors met&#x2014;and bonded with&#x2014;nearly three decades after the battle. This book proves again that Moore is an exceptionally thoughtful, compassionate and courageous leader (he was one of a handful of army officers who studied the history of the Vietnam wars before he arrived) and a strong voice for reconciliation and for honoring the men with whom he served. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(Aug. 19)</i> ""<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Driven, demanding women achieve higher positions, better salaries, and praise for their ambition. They learn to be confident, take-charge leaders who can handle anything on their own. Yet when it comes to their marriages, those same traits can backfire. After all, no one goes into marriage hoping for a promotion. What is a wife to do?</p> <p>April Cassidy knows this struggle firsthand. She thought she was a great Christian wife and begged God to make her passive husband into a more loving, involved, godly leader. Instead, God opened her eyes to changes that she needed to make, such as laying down her desire for control and offering genuine, unconditional respect--not just love--to her husband. <em>The Peaceful Wife</em> focuses on Cassidy's experience and its life-changing properties, providing a template for others to follow.</p> <p>Cassidy's conclusions may be as shocking to readers as they were to her, but she backs up her own tale with stories from her blog readers, and also includes recommendations for further study. She walks through baby steps on how to change, addressing questions such as:</p> <ul><li>What is respect?</li> <li>How can you show respect?</li> <li>How is being respectful different from being loving?</li></ul> <p>In the end, <em>The Peaceful Wife</em> is a powerful path to God's design for women to live in full submission to Christ as Lord.</p></p><p>April Cassidy is a wife, mother of two, part-time pharmacist, and blogger in Columbia, South Carolina.

Through his teachings and leadership as fourth caliph, Ali nourished Islam. But Muslims are divided on whether he was supposed to be Mohammad&#x2019;s political successor&#x2014;and he continues to be a polarizing figure in Islamic history.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hassan Abbas provides a nuanced, compelling portrait of this towering yet divisive figure and the origins of sectarian division within Islam. Abbas reveals how, after Mohammad, Ali assumed the spiritual mantle of Islam to spearhead the movement that the prophet had led. While Ali&#x2019;s teachings about wisdom, justice, and selflessness continue to be cherished by both Shia and Sunni Muslims, his pluralist ideas have been buried under sectarian agendas and power politics. Today, Abbas argues, Ali&#x2019;s legacy and message stands against that of ISIS, Al-Qaeda and Taliban.</p><p><b>Hassan Abbas</b> is distinguished professor of international relations at Near East South Asia Strategic Studies Centre at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.

Millie is a mischievous 10-year-old with a talent for evading homework, a habit of questioning authority, and a knack for inventing bizarre jump rope rhymes. Ozy is her calm, thoughtful counterpart, whose adoptive father, a red dragon named Llewellyn, is full of strange stories and ancient wisdom. Also featured are Felicia, a sheep at the head of the cool clique, and Avery, a hapless raccoon who desperately wants to be popular.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this collection of funny and charming comics, the sweet, philosophical humor of author Dana Simpson (<i>Phoebe and Her Unicorn</i>) shines through. Evocative, funny, and gently philosophical, <i>Ozy and Millie</i> will delight young readers with tales of friendship and school-age fun, while transporting older fans back to the openness and wonder of childhood. <i>Ozy and Millie</i> also includes an introduction by the author and a "More To Explore" section with a glossary and how-to-draw section for young readers. <br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Dana Claire Simpson grew up in Gig Harbor, Washington, drawing the entire time.

Simpson notes that she chose these strips to show a young audience how artists improve over time and that mistakes lead to learning. Representing the entire span of the series, selections have been carefully reviewed to ensure they don't contain dated references. Four-panel, full-color strips center on Ozy and Millie, anthropomorphic foxes who are best friends and complete opposites. While the humor is appropriate for middle graders, the book runs more to adult tastes, owing to the advanced vocabulary and phrasing and references to historical figures and concepts, though a glossary will help younger readers.

I like that name. I stand up to read,&nbsp;but as soon as I open my mouth, my feet start moving. It always happens that way. I can't help it.<br> " 'The youth was in a little trance of astonishment. So they were at last going to fight.' Miss Lesley, why don't the youth have a name?"<br> "Why doesn't the&nbsp;youth have a name," Miss Lesley says, but I go right on. She's always trying to fix our grammar, but we don't pay much mind.<br> "The writer should call him Joe or Henry or something."<br> In the front row, my little brother, Henry, giggles. Miss Lesley touches&nbsp;his head with her hand and he stops. At least she don't smack him with that ruler of hers.<br> "Grace, sit down when you read."<br> "I can't. I don't read as good. When I sit my brain stops working."<br> "Nonsense. Your brain works just like everybody else's. I want you to stay in one place when you read. Stop hopping around the room. Look at Arthur. He can sit still. Now you try it."<br> Arthur's desk is hooked up to mine and he never moves a muscle 'cepting his lips when he's reading. That's why Miss Lesley likes him&nbsp;the best. It's not only 'cause he's the best reader. It's 'cause he's a sitter and the rest of us are hoppers, jumpers, fidgeters. Arthur's twelve too, but he's four months older than me. I can read just as good as him so long as I can move around at the&nbsp;same time.<br> I go on. "'He could not accept with asshur--'"<br> "Assurance," Miss Lesley says. "That means he could not believe. Henry, sit up and listen. Your sister's reading a story."<br> I finish the sentence.

The whole time she's teaching, Miss Lesley&nbsp;moves around the room, keeping us kids in order. I'm back at my desk, but my feet are dancing underneath. Miss Lesley slaps them with her ruler whenever she passes by. I pretend I don't even feel it. Seems she cares more about sitting still than learning.<br> "You older children go on reading among yourselves now. One sentence each, then pass the book."<br> I hate that. I like to hear my voice doing the reading. Or Arthur's. Thomas mumbles so&nbsp;you can't understand him and Norma just pretends to read and Rose is too busy twirling her hair around her finger and staring at Thomas. I hate when the story goes too slow. Then I forget what's happening.<br> ***<br> It's Arthur who's reading when we hear footsteps outside on the wooden porch, the thunk of a boot against the step to knock off the mud. We get still. The man coming through that door understands that Miss Lesley don't like dirt in her classroom.<br> We know who it is. We know what he's going to say. I sneak a peek at Arthur, who's put the book down. For once.<br> Miss Lesley has her ruler raised and suddenly she stops moving too.<br> The door opens. French Johnny pokes his head in first, almost like a little kid asking permission. He went to this schoolhimself. He knows how hard the benches can be after a day of sitting. He knows every hook by the door and the way the handle of the coal stove wriggles out and slams to the floor when someone ain't paying mind. French Johnny is the second hand at the mill.&nbsp;He's in charge of the spinning room where my mother runs six frames. He's come up the hill in his white apron to get a mill rat. That's what they call the kids who work in the mill. We all end up as mill rats.<br> "Yes?" Miss Lesley says with no respect in her voice. She might as well be talking to a second grader like my brother, Henry.<br> "Come for the boy," says French Johnny. He sounds like he don't want to be here. He knows she won't let this one go without a fight. Truth is she argues with him over every&nbsp;single one of us.<br> "Well, you can turn around and walk right out of here. You're not taking him," says Miss Lesley, keeping her back to barrel-bellied French Johnny. She's acting as if he's no bigger than one of those sow bugs come out of the woodwork this&nbsp;time of year. "Class, I want you to pay attention to the board. We're going to make the sound of these two letters." Her ruler smacks the CH. "Chuh," she says to the younger ones. "Repeat after me. Chuh."<br> But nobody says nothing. We're all waiting and watching French Johnny.<br> "Chuh," she says again, her voice rising. She's getting angry.<br> Nobody speaks.<br> I can't stand silence like that.<br> "Chuh," I say, and two of the little kids laugh.<br> French&nbsp;Johnny is all the way in the room now. He's squirmed around the door and closed it behind him.<br> He signals to Arthur, who pays him no mind.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One</h2><p>A funny, tough-minded case for being and having an only child, debunking the myths about only children and taking glory in the pleasures of singletons: &#x201c;A swift and absorbing read...may change your mind and the national conversation&#x201d; (<i>Psychology Today</i>).<br><br>Journalist Lauren Sandler is an only child and the mother of one. After investigating what only children are really like and whether stopping at one child is an answer to reconciling motherhood and modernity, she learned a lot about herself&#x2014;and a lot about our culture&#x2019;s assumptions. In this heartfelt work, Sandler legitimizes a discussion about the larger societal costs of having more than one, which Jessica Grose in her review in <i>The New Republic </i>calls, &#x201c;the vital part of the conversation that&#x2019;s not being discussed in the chatter&#x201d; surrounding parenting. <i> </i><br> <br><i></i>Between the recession, the stresses of modern life, and the ecological dangers ahead, there are increasing pressures on parents to think seriously about singletons. Sandler considers the unique ways that singletons thrive, and why so many of their families are happier. <i>One and Only</i> examines these ideas, including what the rise of the single-child family means for our economies, our environment, and our freedom, leaving the reader &#x201c;informed and sympathetic,&#x201d; writes Nora Krug in the <i>Washington Post</i>.<br> <br>Through this journey, &#x201c;Sandler delves deeply, thoughtfully, and often humorously into history, culture, politics, religion, race, economics, and of course, scientific research&#x201d; writes Lori Gottlieb, <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i> &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t put it down,&#x201d; says Randi Hutter Epstein in the <i>Huffington Post</i>. Sandler &#x201c;isn&#x2019;t proselytizing, she&#x2019;s just stating it like it is. Seductively honest.&#x201d; At the end, Sandler has quite possibly cracked the code of happiness, demonstrating that having just one may be the way to resolve our countless struggles with adulthood in the modern age.</p><p>Lauren Sandler<b> </b>has written on cultural politics, religion, and inequality for <i>Time, The Atlantic, Slate, </i>and<i> The New York Times. </i>She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b></b>One and Only INTRODUCTION<p></p> IT&#x2019;S NOT WHAT YOU THINK<p></p> <br>This is not a memoir, but to conform to what&#x2019;s expected of an only child, let me start with myself.<br> <br>My mother was deeply devoted to raising me. To have a happy kid, she figured she needed to be a happy mother, and to be a happy mother, she needed to be a happy person. To do that, she had to preserve her authentic self, which she could not imagine doing with a second child.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was all about me,&#x201d; she freely admits to me one night, in a way that simultaneously makes my chest swell with pride (feminism!) and my shoulders contract with a cringe (selfishness!). My parents are in Brooklyn for a weekend visit. It&#x2019;s getting close to midnight, and my mother and I are in our nightgowns, tucked under the covers of the sleep couch. My husband, Justin, and my dad are nursing their beers, feet propped up on the foot of the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;When you were three,&#x201d; she goes on, &#x201c;I thought I was pregnant. I stayed up all night making a pros and cons list. By morning, it was clear to me I couldn&#x2019;t have another kid.&#x201d; She easily recites the &#x201c;con&#x201d; litany: she could continue her career uninterrupted, stay in the apartment she loved instead of trading urbanity for a suburban existence, maintain a certain level of independence, and worry less about money.<br> <br>I interrupt her to ask about the &#x201c;pro&#x201d; list. I have no idea what she&#x2019;s going to say. She&#x2019;s never so much as suggested that there would be a competing list. Instead of replying, she continues, &#x201c;I just would have had to be a totally different person with another kid. My life would have utterly changed. Luckily, it turned out I wasn&#x2019;t pregnant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get that, Mom. I do. But what about the other list?&#x201d; She&#x2019;s silent. My father studies the label on his beer bottle. &#x201c;Dad, what did you want?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>My father looks up at me. &#x201c;I so loved parenting; I always wanted the experience to be varied, to go on,&#x201d; he says quietly. A vocal strain belies his next words: &#x201c;But you know me. I&#x2019;m not a regretful person.&#x201d; He looks back down at his bottle. &#x201c;What can I say,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;The years passed. It became the choice. Here we are.&#x201d; He grins at me. &#x201c;Where we are isn&#x2019;t half bad, I might add. It just took me some time to get used to the idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>It takes us all some time to get used to the idea. As only children, we have to get used to lacking something that the majority of people have for better or for worse. As parents who choose to stop at one, we have to get used to the nagging feeling that we are choosing for our own children something they can never undo. We&#x2019;re deciding not to know two kids splashing in the bubble bath, playing in the pile of raked leaves, whispering under the cover of darkness, teasing each other at the dinner table, holding hands at our funerals.<br> <br>Everyone seems to think they know who we are, both singletons and parents of singletons. We are the selfish ones. I must be doubly so, as an only child myself, and the mother of one. Who else but an only child would have the sense of self-importance to write about being one, much less suggest that other people consider it for themselves? But after investigating the whole matter, let me offer this spoiler: I don&#x2019;t buy it.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Lonely. Selfish. Maladjusted. These are the words that Toni Falbo, the leading researcher in the small field of only child studies, uses to explain our image of only children. Falbo lists these characteristics so often, they tend to run together as a single word: lonelyselfishmaladjusted.<br> <br>Why did this idea take hold? The academic basis of the miserable singleton specimen was the work of one man, who famously lectured, &#x201c;Being an only child is a disease in itself.&#x201d; Granville Stanley Hall was a leader of the late-nineteenth-century child-study movement and had a national network of study groups called Hall Clubs that spread his teachings. Not a bad way to disseminate his 1896 study, &#x201c;Of Peculiar and Exceptional Children,&#x201d; which described only children as permanent misfits. Never mind that Hall also openly fetishized his own agrarian, big-brood upbringing and disdained the smaller-family urbanity that was creeping into a rapidly industrializing country. Just consider that Hall&#x2014;and every other fledgling psychologist&#x2014;knew close to nothing about credible research practices.<br> <br>Yet for decades, academics and advice columnists alike spread his conclusion that an only child could not develop the same capacity for adjustment as children with siblings. &#x201c;Over-privileged, asocial, royally autonomous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. self-centered, aloof and overly intellectual,&#x201d; is the culturally perceived &#x201c;unchallengeable given&#x201d; of the only child, as sociologist Judith Blake wrote in her 1989 book Family Size and Achievement, which attempted to scientifically dismantle aspects of the stereotype. Later generations of scholars tried to correct the record, but their findings never filtered into popular parenting discourse. The &#x201c;peculiar&#x201d; only child had permeated pop culture, from oddball sidekicks in eighties sitcoms to demon children in horror films. Hellion only children are legendary on screen: The Shining, The Exorcist, Friday the Thirteenth, and The Butcher Boy are all films that rely on a seriously psychotic singleton (yes, even Psycho) to terrorize their innocent costars.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not just fright-fests that traffic in typecasting only children. Name a genre, and there&#x2019;s a list of characters to give the stereotype narrative heft and form: Tom Ripley, Veruca Salt, Eric Cartman. Even superheroes fit the stereotype, misfit loners incapable of truly connecting with citizens of the real world, suspicious in their overintelligence, often fighting against their privilege. Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Iron Man&#x2014;only children all. But this troubled image projected onto the popular consciousness can be complicated by the real-life heroism of some singletons whose ability to connect with others was central to their own superpowers: you might not know it, but Mahatma Gandhi was an only child too.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Around the time my mother stayed awake on the couch with her pros and cons list, she met with the administrators of my nursery school to convince them to extend hours until six o&#x2019;clock in the evening, to accommodate the needs of working parents. The next morning a squadron of mothers cornered her at the door to the school. Wearing pajamas under their trench coats, they allowed her to drop me off before moving in for the attack. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you,&#x201d; they said. They were fundamentally opposed to her suggestion of an extended day. &#x201c;We wanted to tell you our children are our only priority.&#x201d;<br> <br>During an interview with British psychologist Bernice Sorensen, who wrote a book called The Only-Child Experience &amp; Adulthood, I mention that my mother chose to stop at one and I am considering the same for my family. Her response is to snap, &#x201c;So, your mother is a narcissist, and you&#x2019;re one too if you make that choice, and you will probably ensure the same future for your daughter. Isn&#x2019;t that what you&#x2019;re telling me?&#x201d; Let&#x2019;s just say she&#x2019;s one singleton who didn&#x2019;t enjoy the experience.<br> <br>The majority of parents say they have second children for the sake of their first child, or at least that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ve told Gallup pollsters for decades. But it&#x2019;s hard to imagine anything that can be reduced to a simple survey question, much less an issue that layers notions of family, happiness, responsibility, legacy&#x2014;life and death itself, when you think about it. Still, we all know that there&#x2019;s truth in this response: first children tend to be a choice parents make to fulfill their own lives and a second child tends to be a choice parents make to fulfill the life of their existing child.<br> <br>Some people believe that a family with one child isn&#x2019;t really a family, although I defy anyone to strictly define familial normalcy today. Kids are increasingly&#x2014;and happily&#x2014;raised by same-sex parents (in fact, recent studies suggest that lesbian mothers are the best parents of all). Divorce is as common as not. In vitro fertilization has pushed the possible age of conception into the midforties. Siblings are almost as likely stepbrothers and stepsisters as they are the children of their own biological parents.<br> <br>Such developments in the way we define a family produce questions about how to define an only child. Statisticians tend to use the rule that if you spent your first seven years raised as the sole child in a household, you count as one. But I&#x2019;ve met plenty of people who consider themselves onlies because they felt estranged from stepsiblings, and others who would never think of themselves as singletons, despite an age gap of a dozen-odd years, because of how close they are to a brother or sister. These definitions are murky at best. Some only-child experiences and tendencies will apply to some situations (e.g., the seven-year rule works well when understanding selfishness or achievement), and not to others (e.g., even if your sister was in college when you were born, confronting the death of a parent would be radically different without her). It&#x2019;s erroneous to think there is such a thing as &#x201c;normal&#x201d;&#x2014;much less that we should aspire to such a concept.<br> <br>And still, one of America&#x2019;s most successful exports has been the cultural assertion that joyful families are big families: from Meet Me in St. Louis to the Cheaper by the Dozen remakes, the Partridges to the Duggars. One young woman in China, who was raised in a rural village populated by a generation of only children, tells me she never knew what a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; family looked like until the Chinese television authority permitted reruns of Growing Pains when she was in middle school. &#x201c;The Seaver family was the first &#x2018;real family&#x2019; I had ever seen,&#x201d; she says, admitting a crush on Kirk Cameron and excitedly telling me that the actor who played Ben Seaver married a gal from Shanghai. &#x201c;They seemed so happy together&#x2014;why wouldn&#x2019;t I want that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody wants that&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not what people imagine for their lives,&#x201d; says sociologist Philip Morgan at the Carolina Population Center when I ask him to discuss the rising number of only children. In surveys that ask young women how many children they&#x2019;d like to have, ultimately and ideally, no one says they&#x2019;d choose to stop at one child, he tells me. To me, that&#x2019;s like asking a tween girl what her perfect wedding looks like. My childhood fantasy was to get married on an island in Boston&#x2019;s Public Garden in a dress my grandmother would take me shopping for in Paris, with a swing band and guests encircling me and my groom in floating Swan Boats. Instead, my grandmother was confined to a nursing ward, I wore a two-hundred-dollar off-the-rack dress, we got hitched at my parents&#x2019; house and danced to a six-hour mix we made that blew out my dad&#x2019;s speakers. My grandmother&#x2019;s absence aside, it was grand. We envision one thing; we live with another. Our ideals change in concert with our emerging realities&#x2014;even more so if, as we develop, we opt to interrogate what we thought we wanted, and why we thought we wanted it.<br> <br>Here are some things I want: I want to do meaningful work. I want to travel. I want to eat in restaurants and drink in bars. I want to go to movies and concerts. I want to read novels. I want to marinate in solitude. I want to have friendships that regularly sustain and exhilarate me. I want a romantic relationship that involves daily communication beyond interrogatives and imperatives&#x2014;I want to be known. And I want to snuggle with my daughter for as long as she&#x2019;ll let me, being as present in her life as I can while giving her all the space she needs to discover life on her own terms. I want full participation: in the world, in my family, in my friendships, and in my own actualization.<br> <br>In other words, to have a happy kid, I figure I need to be a happy mother, and to be a happy mother, I need to be a happy person. Like my mother, I feel that I need to make choices within the limits of reality&#x2014;which means considering work, finances, pleasure&#x2014;and at the moment I can&#x2019;t imagine how I could possibly do that with another kid. Someone once asked Alice Walker if women (well, woman artists) should have children. She replied, &#x201c;They should have children&#x2014;assuming this is of interest to them&#x2014;but only one.&#x201d; Why? &#x201c;Because with one you can move,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;With more than one, you&#x2019;re a sitting duck.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, I agonize every time I see my daughter doting on a friend&#x2019;s baby, just as my own heart has a tendency to devour itself whole when I take a new tiny person in my arms, inhaling its sweetness, nuzzling that soft neck, thrilling to every smile and coo. When my daughter was born, after all my anxiety about how I&#x2019;d never changed a diaper, all my avowing that I prefer living things who can verbally communicate, all my certainty that bonding would be an infinite process, and all my fear that I would never again live life on my own terms&#x2014;well, I held my girl, just moments old, and I simply knew what to do. My confidence and capability stunned me. Justin&#x2019;s too&#x2014;though I always knew he was up to the task. And yet when I try to imagine doing it again, I feel even greater doubt than I did the first time.<br> <br>There are plenty of parents who deeply want more than one child and are willing to make profound compromises to have the family they want. These are not people beset with ambivalence or fear that they will forever damage their first child by not offering it the gift of a sibling. These are parents who know what they&#x2019;re in for and know what sacrifices they&#x2019;re willing to make for it. The last thing we need is another person telling women what they should or should not do with their fallopian tubes, their finances, and their futures. I&#x2019;m not here to preach the Gospel of the Only Child.<br> <br>What I&#x2019;m saying is this: when we obsess about which stroller to buy, or whether to go with cloth or paper diapers, or whether organic produce is a must, or whether Mozart or Mingus will make our babies brilliant, or if we&#x2019;ve overscheduled or underscheduled or overfed or underfed or overvaccinated or undervaccinated our kids, yet we fail to consider whether we should actually be having another child, it&#x2019;s time to change the conversation.<br> <br>We ask when people are having kids&#x2014;never a kid, never one child at a time, which is how it usually happens. If a kid has no siblings, it&#x2019;s assumed that there&#x2019;s a hush-hush reason for it: that parents don&#x2019;t like parenthood (because they are selfish), or they care about their status&#x2014;work, money, materialism&#x2014;more than their kid (because they are selfish), or they waited too long (because they are selfish).<br> <br>Over the past century, adulthood has come to promise more than just duty, but pleasure. We search for a partner who will satisfy our desires, develop a career that reflects our strengths, build a life that suits not just our needs, but our wants. Despite the fact that it&#x2019;s no longer possible to have a middle-class life on one income&#x2014;and often not even on two&#x2014;we envision a liberated existence, one of satisfaction and fulfillment, a life built upon intentionality and individualism rather than obligation and role filling. This liberated adulthood exists at odds with parenting.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t take forced population control to raise the number of a country&#x2019;s only children&#x2014;the relative incompatibility of motherhood and modernity has taken care of that. Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Korea all have fertility rates of less than 1.4 per woman, about half the number of kids women in those countries were having in the seventies. While family policy that helps to manage the collision between work and parenthood&#x2014;and particularly motherhood&#x2014;is nearly nonexistent in the United...</p><h2>Green Architecture</h2><p><p>The most exciting new buildings today are almost all environmentally aware, sustainable, and conceived to consume less energy than ever before.

Beth calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers. Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives.<br><br>Cool and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach, Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life. Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden circle, waging a subtle but vicious campaign to regain her position as "top girl" -- both with the team and with Addy herself. <br><br>Then a suicide focuses a police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. <br><br>The raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching exploration of friendship, ambition, and power. Award-winning novelist Megan Abbott, writing with what Tom Perrotta has hailed as "total authority and an almost desperate intensity," provides a harrowing glimpse into the dark heart of the all-American girl.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2012</strong>: Oh my, these beautiful, terrible girls, with their "Aruba-tanned" legs and their ferocity and fears, for whom the smallest slights become life-and-death matters. This brilliantly dark and uncomfortably real story, sharp and suspenseful and chilling, made me desperately glad I have sons. The author is so attuned to the "witchiness of girls" and the drama of high school, and then she takes us to the darkest corners of that world. These aren't <i>Mean Girls</i> or <i>Breakfast Club</i> teens--more like <i>Glee</i> on steroids. Megan Abbott is a scary genius. Her voice is fierce and fearless. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>Megan Abbott is the Edgar Award-winning author of five previous novels. She received her Ph.D. in literature from New York University and has taught literature, writing, and film at NYU, the New School, and SUNY-Oswego.

Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I've done at measuring up to the values I myself have set."<br> &#x2014;Sidney Poitier</p><p>In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure&#x2014;as a man, as a husband and a father, and as an actor.</p><p>Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. "In the kind of place where I grew up," recalls Poitier, "what's coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma's voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters...and that's it." Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.</p><p>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates to who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.</p><p>Here is Poitier's own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, price and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man in the face of limits&#x2014;his own and the world's. A triumph of the spirit, <em>The Measure of a Man</em> captures the essential Poitier.</p></p><p>Sidney Poitier wrote <i>The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography</i> because he "felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the difference between 'amusing ourselves to death' and finding meaningful pleasures--even joy." Yet Poitier's book does not speak from on high; its tone is conversational and endearingly self-critical. He begins the first chapter by recounting an evening spent channel-surfing and wondering, as most of us do at one time or another, "What am I doing with my time?" The spiritual reflections in <i>The Measure of a Man</i> are nonsectarian; Poitier's faith is clearly influenced by his experience in Christian churches, but he is not, strictly, Christian. Though idiosyncratic, his faith is disciplined and rigorous, informed by leaders as diverse as Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Poitier's love--for himself, his family, and the world--infuses his recollections of his early life on Cat Island in the Bahamas and his memories of his stage and film career (including his Oscar-winning role in <i>Lilies of the Field</i>). Poitier has been rich and poor; he has been popular and despised; and his extremely varied experiences have made him a wise man, as he demonstrates with statements like this one: "[W]hat we do is stay within the context of what's practical, what's real, what dreams can be fashioned into reality, what values can send us to bed comfortably and make us courageous enough to face our end with character."<p>Sidney Poitier was the first black actor to win the Academy Award for best actor for his outstanding performance in <em>Lilies of the Field</em> in 1963. His landmark films include <em>The Defiant Ones</em>, <em>A Patch of Blue</em>, <em>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</em>, and <em>To Sir, With Love</em>. He has starred in over forty films, directed nine, and written four. He is the author of two autobiographies: <em>This Life</em> and the "Oprah's Book Club" pick and <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Measure of a Man</em>. Among many other accolades, Poitier has been awarded the Screen Actors Guild's highest honor, the Life Achievement Award, for an outstanding career and humanitarian accomplishment. He is married, has six daughters, four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.</p></p><h2>Understanding and Using Educational Theories</h2><p>This textbook gives readers a clear overview of a selection of the most influential thinkers on education in the last hundred year, including established names (Vygotsky, Bruner, Dewey), more recent thinkers (Freire, hooks, Claxton) and other key names whose writing has helped shaped our views on teaching and learning.&nbsp;This second edition includes new chapters on Albert Bandura, Dylan Wiliam and Carol Dweck.<br> <br> Each chapter includes:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Practical examples showing how theories can be used to inform classroom teaching </li> <li>Critiques of each theorist exploring opposing viewpoints and the strengths and weaknesses of different ideas </li> <li>Reflective tasks inviting you to apply what you&#x2032;ve read to your own educational experiences.&nbsp; </li> </ul> <p><strong><em>This book is not available as a print inspection copy.

Weaned on Cole Porter, Nat King Cole, Mick&#x2014;and his beloved Janis Joplin&#x2014;Tyler began tearing up the streets and the stage as a teenager before finally meeting his "mutant twin" and legendary partner Joe Perry. In this addictively readable memoir, told in the playful, poetic voice that is uniquely his own, Tyler unabashedly recounts the meteoric rise, fall, and rise of Aerosmith over the last three decades and riffs on the music that gives it all meaning.</p><p>Tyler tells what it's like to be a living legend and the frontman of one of the world's most revered and infamous bands&#x2014;the debauchery, the money, the notoriety, the fights, the motels and hotels, the elevators, limos, buses and jets, the rehab. He reveals the spiritual side that "gets lost behind the stereotype of the Sex Guy, the Drug Guy, the Demon of Screamin', the Terror of the Tropicana." And he talks about his epic romantic life and his relationship with his four children.

The band has sold more than 100 million records across the globe and won numerous prestigious awards&#x2014;multiple Grammys, American Music awards, Billboard awards, and MTV awards&#x2014;and was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.</p><p>Aerosmith has infiltrated rock history with their memorable appearances in <em>Wayne's World</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em>, at the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, and in their own Aerosmith version of Guitar Hero. Their number one single, "Don't Want to Miss a Thing," was nominated for an Academy Award for best song for the movie <em>Armageddon</em>.

When the gray gelding had arrived, the place had been packed with horses of all shapes and sizes, tied side by side along both walls. People had wandered along the sunken walkway in between, occasionally stepping closer to lift a horse&#x2019;s hoof or to flip its lip up to look for a tattoo and to check its teeth. None of the people had bothered the gray horse, however. And now, hours later, the aisle was nearly deserted.<br> <br>Boy and horse turned the corner into the center part of the building, where the horse fell into step behind four others, all workhorses like him but mostly much older and stoutly built, with the thick legs and massive necks of draft animals. One of the big drafts had a badly galled shoulder, and a black gelding&#x2019;s back was swayed from hard work and old age. All four showed ribs through their shaggy, unkempt coats.<br> <br>The gray was showing the outline of ribs as well, and clearly hadn&#x2019;t been groomed in a while. But unlike the others, who plodded along without raising their heads, he looked around with interest, pricking his small ears as he passed through a gate into the narrow sales ring bordered on both sides by tall wooden bleachers. Earlier, this place had been filled with people, too. Now, only a few remained. The gray gelding met the eye of one of them, a stocky man wearing a heavy mackinaw coat and a cloth cap with the earflaps pulled down against the chill of the unheated building. But the man barely seemed to see the gray before turning to look at the rest.<br> <br>As the gray horse passed him, the man spat a wad of tobacco onto the ground. &#x201c;Sixty a head,&#x201d; he called in a raspy voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sold.&#x201d; Another man, sitting at the wooden desk overlooking the ring, gathered the papers lying before him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all, folks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This way.&#x201d; The youth at the gray&#x2019;s head tugged again on his halter, leading him back out of the ring with the others. &#x201c;Sorry, pal, looks like it&#x2019;s end of the road for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The parking lot at New Holland Sales Stables was already clearing out when Harry deLeyer steered his station wagon past cars, horse trailers, and Amish buggies. A few people were still loading the horses they&#x2019;d bought, but Harry paid little attention to them. He had been to the auction before and knew how it worked. Every Monday, all year round, people came from near and far to buy and sell horses. There, one could find anything from enormous drafts weary from pulling a plow to sleek, spirited show horses to furry ponies; from high-headed saddlebreds to Thoroughbred ex-racers to horses whose breeding was anybody&#x2019;s guess. The buyers varied just as much. Amish farmers looking over the plow and buggy horses with a practiced eye. Trainers looking for a lesson horse or show horse at a bargain price. Families looking for an inexpensive pony for the kids. Many of the horses went home with such buyers, while other sales led to the area in the back known as &#x201c;the kill pen.&#x201d; That was where the meat buyers kept the horses they purchased, loading them up at the end of the day for one final trailer ride to the canning plant.<br> <br>That day it was snowy and bitterly cold, and Harry saw one of the meat buyers loading his truck as he pulled to a stop. He grimaced, partly because he knew the fate of the unlucky animals being loaded. It was very different from how he remembered things from his childhood in Holland, where a horse that had served his owners faithfully earned a pleasant retirement grazing in a sunny pasture.<br> <br>Harry was also disappointed to be arriving at the sale so late. He&#x2019;d had a flat tire on the long drive down from Long Island, New York. In those days, changing a tire was no simple matter&#x2014;Harry had had to go to a service station for a new inner tube, which had put him far behind schedule. Now, he could see that the auction was over. That was too bad, since he&#x2019;d been hoping to find a lesson horse for the stable he&#x2019;d managed at an exclusive private school, the Knox School for Girls, for the past couple of years.<br> <br>Still, he&#x2019;d made the long drive through the snow from his home farm on Long Island all the way here to Pennsylvania. He figured he might as well take a look at what was left.<br> <br>Harry climbed out of his car and stretched, his blue eyes never leaving the meat buyer&#x2019;s trailer. When he looked inside, the horses stood empty-eyed and resigned, no longer interested in what was going on around them.<br> <br>All except one. A gray gelding was looking around, ears pricked. He was just as beat-up and dirty as the others, but there was something about him that caught Harry&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;especially when the horse turned and met his gaze. Was Harry seeing things, or had the gelding just winked one big brown eye at him?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to look that gray horse over,&#x201d; he told the meat buyer in his thick Dutch accent, nodding toward the gelding.<br> <br>The buyer laughed. &#x201c;You crazy? He&#x2019;s just a used-up farm horse.&#x201d;<br> <br>Harry merely smiled. &#x201c;Mind getting him down so I can have a look?&#x201d;<br> <br>The buyer shrugged and then unfastened the ramp he&#x2019;d just latched. He lowered it, and before he could reach for the gray, Harry was inside grabbing the horse by the mane.<br> <br>The gray gelding stepped down, stumbling halfway and sliding ungracefully to the ground. Harry let go and jumped out of the way. Although the meat buyer had already removed the halters from the horses in his truck, neither he nor Harry was particularly worried that the battered horse would try to run away, and indeed, the gray stood still once he was out.<br> <br>Harry looked him over carefully. The horse stood a little more than sixteen hands by his estimation, and he was perhaps eight years old or thereabouts. He was solidly built, though certainly no draft horse despite the harness marks across his chest. Harry was surprised to note the small ears&#x2014;&#x201c;Arabian ears,&#x201d; he would call them. Other than those ears, the horse&#x2019;s best quality seemed to be his large, kind eyes. The rest of him showed the signs of hard work and poor care. His mane and tail were unkempt, and his hooves were chipped and dull, with only one worn-out shoe still clinging on by a couple of nails.<br> <br>But he wasn&#x2019;t as thin as some of the horses that ended up in the buyers&#x2019; kill pen, and his basic conformation was adequate. Besides, there was just something Harry liked about him. He might not be anything special, but seemed easy-going and quiet, so he might do as a lesson horse for some of the bigger girls at the Knox School.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you want for him?&#x201d; Harry asked the meat buyer.<br> <br>The man looked surprised, but was quick to nod when Harry offered eighty dollars&#x2014;ten for profit and ten for delivering the horse to Harry&#x2019;s farm on Long Island.<br> <br>&#x201c;You just bought yourself a horse, mister.&#x201d; The meat buyer grinned, probably thinking that Harry had just paid way too much for a useless horse.<br> <br>Harry was thinking much the same thing himself. Still, he couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at the gray gelding as he led him back up the ramp into the trailer.</p><h2>The Art of Work: A Proven Path to Discovering What You Were Meant to Do</h2><p><b><i>USA TODAY, WASHINGTON POST, AND PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY BESTSELLER!</i></b><br><br>Jeff Goins, a brilliant new voice counting Seth Godin and Jon Acuff among his fans, explains how to abandon the status quo and live a life that matters with true passion and purpose. <br><br>The path to your life's work is difficult and risky, even scary, which is why few finish the journey. This is a book about discovering your life's work, that treasure of immeasurable worth we all long for. It's about the task you were born to do. <br><br>As Jeff Goins explains, the search begins with passion but does not end there. Only when our interests connect with the needs of the world do we begin living for a larger purpose. Those who experience this intersection experience something exceptional and enviable. Though it is rare, such a life is attainable by anyone brave enough to try. <br><br>Through personal experience, compelling case studies, and current research on the mysteries of motivation and talent, Jeff shows readers how to find their vocation and what to expect along the way.</p><p>"What's happened to you is rare," my friend Mark said to me just before I made one of the most important decisions of my life--the decision to quit my job and become a full-time writer. My last day at work also happened to be my thirtieth birthday, which made it a milestone in many respects. The truth, though, is the day itself was less significant than the process it took to get there. <br><br>When asked how I got to this point, I struggle to give an intelligent answer. The experience of finding your calling can be both mysterious and practical. It takes effort but also seems to happen to you at times. What I've come to understand is that finding your purpose is more of a path than a plan: it involves twists and turns that you never expected. Ultimately these surprises lead you to your destiny. And once you arrive at what you thought was the destination, you realize it's only another leg in the journey. <br><br>This book is a description of that path, as well as the steps it takes to navigate it. <br><br>Everyone, it seems, is searching for a purpose, for something to satisfy their deepest desires. I believe that "something" is a calling. <br><br>What is a calling? You will hear me use the word interchangeably with the terms vocation and life's work, but quite simply, it is the reason you were born. <br><br>When I began working on this project, I thought I knew what the process of pursuing a dream looked like, but what I found surprised me. Discovering your calling, it turns out, isn't quite so simple. The journey looks different for each person, but there are common themes that consistently emerge. If we look at those themes, we can identify a pattern that will help us understand our own vocations a little better. <br><br>What if what happened to me wasn't so rare? What if everyone has a calling? That was the question that sent me on my journey. The people whose stories appear in this book, many of whom I personally interviewed, are not extraordinary, in the sense that you've heard their stories before. <br><br>They are not typical case studies for success, and that was intentional. In these seemingly ordinary accounts, I think we understand our own stories, which often feel far too ordinary for our liking, a little better. Some readers might be disappointed with the subjectivity of such a book. But this is the way we live our lives--not as research projects and book reports--but as anecdotes and emotions. And in each experience, we find certain truths we might otherwise miss. My hope is these stories connect with you in ways that plain facts cannot, and in reading them, you too are changed. <br><br>The Art of Work was not the book I intended to write but ended up being the one I was supposed to write. A calling is like that too, I suppose. It is the thing that you never thought would be, the twist in the plot that makes everything else come together, and somehow in the end you cannot imagine otherwise.&nbsp;Writing this book illuminated my own understanding of how purpose and vocation work together, and I hope it does the same for you.DON'T SETTLE FOR THE STATUS QUO. LIFE A LIFE THAT MATTERS.<br><br>Life seldom unfolds the way we hope or plan. The twists, surprises, and setbacks leave us feeling stuck with no options left by to play it safe--to conform to what's expected of us. But what if there was more to life than this?<br><br>Jeff Goins envisions a better way, a daring journey to discover your life's work. <i>The Art of Work</i> recaptures the ancient understanding of vocation as more than a job, or even a career, but as a passion-fueled calling that makes each day an exciting adventure. <br><br>A calling is not some special opportunity reserved for an elite class of people. Meaningful work is available to anyone who dares to find it. The path before you is a perilous one, full of difficulty and challenges, but it leads to a legacy the world will not soon forget.</p><h2>Above All Else: A World Champion Skydiver&#39;s Story of Survival and What It Taught Him About Fear, Adversity, and Success</h2><p>World famous competitive skydiver and coach Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld presents proven tools and techniques for success and explains how they can be used in everyday life.

Here, she invites us into a conversation as she shares her reflections stemming from not only personal faith but also decades of observation and analysis.

The action was intended to stop Pacific Lumber, a division of the Maxxam Corporation, from the environmentally destructive process of clear-cutting the ancient redwood and the trees around it. The area immediately next to Luna had already been stripped and, because, as many believed, nothing was left to hold the soil to the mountain, a huge part of the hill had slid into the town of Stafford, wiping out many homes.</p><p>Over the course of what turned into an historic civil action, Hill endured El Nino storms, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and the tremendous sorrow brought about by an old-growth forest's destruction. This story-written while she lived on a tiny platform eighteen stories off the ground-is one that only she can tell.</p><p>Twenty-five-year-old Julia Butterfly Hill never planned to become what some have called her-the Rosa Parks of the environmental movement. Shenever expected to be honored as one of <i>Good Housekeeping's</i> "Most Admired Women of 1998" and <i>George</i> magazine's "20 Most Interesting Women in Politics," to be featured in <i>People</i> magazine's "25 Most Intriguing People of the Year" issue, or to receive hundreds of letters weekly from young people around the world. Indeed, when she first climbed into Luna, she had no way of knowing the harrowing weather conditions and the attacks on her and her cause. She had no idea of the loneliness she would face or that her feet wouldn't touch ground for more than two years.</p></p><p>A young woman named Julia Butterfly Hill climbed a 200-foot redwood in December 1997. She didn't come down for 738 days. The tree, dubbed Luna, grows in the coastal hills of Northern California, on land owned by the Maxxam Corporation. In 1985 Maxxam acquired the previous landlord, Pacific Lumber, then proceeded to "liquidate its assets" to pay off the debt--in other words, clear-cut the old-growth redwood forest. Environmentalists charged the company with harvesting timber at a nonsustainable level. Earth First! in particular devised tree sit-ins to protest the logging. When Hill arrived on the scene after traveling cross-country on a whim, loggers were preparing to clear-cut the hillside where Luna had been growing for 1,000 years. <i>The Legacy of Luna</i>, part diary, part treatise, and part New Age spiritual journey, is the story of Julia Butterfly Hill's two-year arboreal odyssey. <p> The daughter of an itinerant preacher, Hill writes of her chance meeting with California logging protesters, the blur of events leading to her ascent of the redwood, and the daily privations of living in the tallest treehouse on earth. She weathers everything from El Ni�o rainstorms to shock-jock media storms. More frightening are her interactions with the loggers below, who escalate the game of chicken by cutting dangerously close to Luna (eventually succeeding at killing another activist with such tactics). "'You'd better get ready for a bad hair day!'" one logger shouts up, grimly anticipating the illegal helicopter hazing she would soon get. Celebrity environmentalists like Joan Baez and Woody Harrelson stop by, too. The notoriety has, on balance, been good to Hill and her cause. <i>George</i> magazine named her one of the "Ten Most Fascinating People in Politics," <i>Good Housekeeping</i> readers nominated her one of the "Most Admired Women" in 1998, and she was featured in <i>People</i>'s "Most Intriguing People of the Year" issue. As a result, more Americans know about controversial forestry practices; it remains to be seen, however, whether public outrage is enough to save California's unprotected and ever-shrinking groves of redwoods. While an agreement allowed Hill to descend from her aerie and Luna to escape the saw, most of the surrounding old-growth forest in the region has been felled or will fall shortly. Still, Hill is optimistic: "Luna is only one tree. We will save her, but we will lose others. The more we stand up and demand change, though, the more things will improve." <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p>It is critical to point out that Legacy of Luna is printed on paper made from 30% post-consumer recycled fibers and 70% Forestry Stewardship Council-certified paper using soy based ink. There is no more responsible paper available. It&#39;s quite insane to suggest that Julia would devote her life to saving trees only to have them sacrificed for her book. Instead, this book is a model of the sustainability available to all of us. Furthermore, it is instructive to know that she is not receiving penny from the profits of this book -- they are all going to the Circle of Life Foundation whose work is to promote sustainabiliy, restoration and preservation of life.</p><h2>The Civil War Trilogy Box Set: With American Homer: Reflections on Shelby Foote and His Classic The Civil War: A Narrative (Modern Library)</h2><p><b><b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time</b><br></b><br>On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, the Modern Library publishes Shelby Foote&#x2019;s three-volume masterpiece in a new boxed set including three hardcovers and a new trade paperback, <i>American Homer: Reflections on Shelby Foote and His Classic Civil War: A Narrative,</i> edited by and with an introduction from Pulitzer Prize winner Jon Meacham and including essays by Michael Beschloss, Ken Burns, Annette Gordon-Reed, and others.<br> <br>Random House publisher Bennett Cerf commissioned southern novelist Shelby Foote to write a short, one-volume history of the American Civil War. Thirty years and a million and a half words later&#x2014;every word having been written out longhand with nib pens dipped into ink&#x2014;Foote published the third and final volume of what has become the classic narrative of that epic war.<br> <br>As he approached the end of the final volume, Foote recounted this scene in a letter to his friend, the novelist Walker Percy: &#x201c;I killed Lincoln last week&#x2014;Saturday, at noon. While I was doing it (he had his chest arched up, holding his last breath to let it out) some halfassed doctor came to the door with vols I and II under his arm, wanting me to autograph them for his son for Xmas. I was in such a state of shock, I not only let him in; I even signed the goddam books, a thing I seldom do. Then I turned back and killed him and had Stanton say, &#x2018;Now he belongs to the ages.&#x2019; A strange feeling, though. I have another 70-odd pages to go, and I have a fear they&#x2019;ll be like Hamlet with Hamlet left out. Christ, what a man. It&#x2019;s been a great thing getting to know him as he was, rather than as he has come to be&#x2014;a sort of TV image of himself, with a ghost alongside.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Percy read the final book, he wrote to Foote: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a noble work. I&#x2019;m still staggered by the size of the achievement. . . . It is <i>The Iliad</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>A selection of these letters, along with essays by Jon Meacham, Michael Beschloss, Ken Burns, Annette Gordon-Reed, Michael Eric Dyson, Julia Reed, Robert Loomis, Donald Graham, John M. McCardell, Jr., and Jay Tolson, are included in<i> American Homer,</i> the bonus paperback book available only in the Modern Library boxed set of <i>The Civil War. </i><br> <br>Shelby Foote&#x2019;s tremendous, sweeping narrative of the most fascinating conflict in our history&#x2014;a war that lasted four long, bitter years, an experience more profound and meaningful than any other the American people have ever lived through&#x2014;begins with Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s resignation from the United States Senate and Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s departure from Springfield for the national capital. It is these two leaders, whose lives continually touch on the great chain of events throughout the story, who are only the first of scores of exciting personalities that in effect make <i>The Civil War</i> a multiple biography set against the crisis of an age.<br> <br>Four years later, Lincoln&#x2019;s second inaugural sets the seal, invoking &#x201c;charity for all&#x201d; on the Eve of Five Forks and the Grant-Lee race for Appomattox. Here is the dust and stench of war, a sort of Twilight of the Gods. The epilogue is Lincoln in his grave, and Davis in his postwar existence&#x2014;&#x201c;Lucifer in Starlight.&#x201d; So ends a unique achievement&#x2014;already recognized as one of the finest histories ever fashioned by an American&#x2014;a narrative that re-creates on a vast and brilliant canvas the events and personalities of an American epic: the Civil War.</p><p>This beautifully written trilogy of books on the American Civil War is not only a piece of first-rate history, but also a marvelous work of literature. Shelby Foote brings a skilled novelist's narrative power to this great epic. Many know Foote for his prominent role as a commentator on Ken Burns's PBS series about the Civil War. These three books, however, are his legacy. His southern sympathies are apparent: the first volume opens by introducing Confederate President Jefferson Davis, rather than Abraham Lincoln. But they hardly get in the way of the great story Foote tells. This hefty three volume set should be on the bookshelf of any Civil War buff. <i>--John Miller</i>Foote&#39;s comprehensive history of the Civil War includes three compelling volumes: Fort Sumter to Perryville, Fredericksburg to Meridian, and Red River to Appomattox.</p><h2>May You Live a Life You Love &#x2014; Featuring quotes and statements that offer well-wishes on any occasion.</h2><p>May you delight in seeing what you are capable of.

Binz, biblical scholar, author, and speaker<br><br>John Michael Talbot is not only a troubadour of God, but over 25 years ago founded a modern community of men and women. In this book he returns to the roots of Christian monasticism and, based on his own lived experience, comments on the Rule of Benedict, to make its spiritual riches fruitful for us contemporary men and women. He reads the Rule with a modern eye and opens it up as much for people who live in a community as those living in the world of everyday work. For this reason, these meditations are also suitable for Benedictine secular oblates. A life based on the principles of the Rule of Benedict makes the world a more Christian and more human place. And with this, Benedict himself becomes a blessing for our times.Notker Wolf, OSB, Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Order <br><br>This handy introduction to the Rule of Benedict would be an ideal gift for someone seeking an overview of St. Benedict&#x2019;s teaching.

This is a portrait of a skilled leader who, despite his conservative inclinations, found a middle path through the bitter partisanship of his era. At home, Eisenhower affirmed the central elements of the New Deal, such as Social Security; fought the demagoguery of Senator Joseph McCarthy; and advanced the agenda of civil rights for African-Americans. Abroad, he ended the Korean War and avoided a new quagmire in Vietnam. Yet he also charted a significant expansion of America&#x2019;s missile technology and deployed a vast array of covert operations around the world to confront the challenge of communism. As he left office, he cautioned Americans to remain alert to the dangers of a powerful military-industrial complex that could threaten their liberties.<br> <br>Today, presidential historians rank Eisenhower fifth on the list of great presidents, and William Hitchcock&#x2019;s &#x201c;rich narrative&#x201d; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>) shows us why Ike&#x2019;s stock has risen so high.

Edward Beach Jr., Eisenhower&#x2019;s naval aide, &#x201c;I like to recall an incident that took place aboard the presidential yacht Williamsburg shortly after he was inaugurated for his first term in 1953.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Williamsburg, a steel-hulled vessel of 1,800 tons, had served as President Harry S. Truman&#x2019;s pleasure craft; he used it for cruises with friends and political cronies. In May 1953 President Eisenhower ordered it decommissioned. He thought the ship frivolous and wasteful and felt it should be used for recreation by GIs who had been injured in the Korean War. One evening the president met the ship at the dock in the Washington Navy Yard as it returned from a cruise on the Potomac.<br> <br>&#x201c;As Eisenhower boarded the Williamsburg, he stepped in among the soldiers, brushing aside his Secret Service guards with words to the effect, &#x2018;Just let me be for a while. I know these men.&#x2019;?&#x201d; Captain Beach remembered the scene:<br> <br>The soldiers crowded in around him. They were young men whose bodies had been ravaged by war in some way; some lacked an arm or a leg, some hobbled on crutches, others had heartbreaking facial disfigurements. . . . They gathered as close to the President as they could get, and I heard him talking to them.<br> <br>This was an Eisenhower that the public never saw. He talked to the soldiers of love of country, and of sacrifice. He said their country would never let them down, but no matter how much it did for them it was nothing compared to what they had done for it. And then he said that even with all they had already given, they must yet be prepared to give more, for they were symbols of devotion and sacrifice and they could never escape that role and its responsibilities.<br> <br>Beach never forgot the electricity of Eisenhower&#x2019;s presence and the impact it had on these wounded warriors. &#x201c;His voice had a deep friendly warmth, with a somewhat different timbre than I had ever heard before. It reached out and grabbed the men around him, so that they kept crowding in closer and closer as he talked, as if an unseen magnet were pulling at them.&#x201d;1<br> <br>Historians who study Eisenhower know how those men felt in his presence. Ike draws you in. He radiated authenticity, idealism, sincerity, and charisma, and these personal qualities were the keys to his political success. Between 1945 and 1961 no person dominated American public life more than Eisenhower. He was the most well-liked and admired man in America in these years. And he was also the most consequential. This book argues that the era from the end of the Second World War up to the presidency of John F. Kennedy deserves to be known as the Age of Eisenhower.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Such a claim would once have prompted chuckles and even sneers from historians, journalists, and politicians. From the start of his active pursuit of the presidency in 1951, right through eight years in office, and for a decade after he retired to his farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, critics styled Eisenhower as a lightweight, an amateur, an orthodox pro-business do-nothing president, a lazy leader who, despite all his grinning, was often callous and distant, more interested in golf than governing. The Washington press corps depicted him as unimaginative, slow-witted, out of touch, and frankly uninterested in the daily affairs of the country. Even as the nation enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity at home and a stable if fragile peace abroad, and even as the American people grew ever more fond of Ike, his political rivals were scathing about his shortcomings as a leader. It is the central paradox of the Eisenhower presidency: that a man so successful at the ballot box and so overwhelmingly popular among the voters could have been given such poor marks by the political class.<br> <br>His critics never grasped the profound appeal of the man and never appreciated the depth of his political talent. His two-time opponent for the presidency, Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, mocked Eisenhower as dim and tongue-tied and declared him little more than a tool of wealthy right-wingers. President Truman, campaigning on Stevenson&#x2019;s behalf in 1952, went further: he told whistle-stop audiences across the country that Eisenhower had only &#x201c;a military mind&#x201d; and that voters should &#x201c;send Ike back to the Army where he belongs.&#x201d; The radical muckraker I. F. Stone, writing what many liberals felt, predicted that Ike, a &#x201c;rather simple man who enjoys his bridge and his golf and doesn&#x2019;t like to be too much bothered,&#x201d; would be a &#x201c;president in absentia.&#x201d; Even after his resounding triumph at the polls in 1952, Eisenhower still earned nothing but scorn from his critics. &#x201c;Poor Ike,&#x201d; Truman said on his way out of office. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be a bit like the Army. He&#x2019;ll sit here, and he&#x2019;ll say, &#x2018;Do this! Do that!&#x2019; And nothing will happen.&#x201d;2<br> <br>His presidency changed few minds among the commentators. A 1958 book by journalist Marquis Childs described Ike as a &#x201c;captive hero,&#x201d; a man unable to make decisions, passive, complacent&#x2014;little more than a ventriloquist&#x2019;s dummy who mouthed words prepared by others. That same year the New York Post&#x2019;s Washington columnist William V. Shannon drew up a balance sheet and concluded that Eisenhower had largely sustained the policies of his Democratic predecessors in both the domestic and the international realm and had made almost no major initiatives of his own. &#x201c;The Eisenhower era,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;is the time of the great postponement.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Norman Mailer, the novelist, was nastier. In a celebrated 1960 essay in Esquire that hailed the nomination of the youthful and energetic John F. Kennedy for president, Mailer derided Eisenhower&#x2019;s era of &#x201c;security, regularity, order.&#x201d; The 1950s for Mailer was a time when &#x201c;many a mind atrophied from disuse and private shame.&#x201d; Mailer struck a note that has continued to reverberate ever since in some circles: &#x201c;Eisenhower&#x2019;s eight years have been the triumph of the corporation. Tasteless, sexless, odorless sanctity.&#x201d;4<br> <br>With Eisenhower&#x2019;s departure from office in January 1961, critics gleefully got out their spades and began to bury the ex-president. On the eve of Kennedy&#x2019;s inauguration, New York Times journalist James Reston wrote an essay on the Eisenhower years that read like an epitaph. Eisenhower &#x201c;was not in tune with the world-wide spirit of the age, which was convulsive and revolutionary.&#x201d; He was merely &#x201c;a good man in a wicked time; a consolidator in a world crying for innovation; a conservative in a radical age; a tired man in a period of turbulence and energetic action.&#x201d; Scholars agreed. In July 1962 Harvard historian Arthur Schlesinger Sr. published the results of a poll that asked 75 historians to rank the presidents. Eisenhower placed 22nd out of 31 chief executives, nestled between Chester A. Arthur and, incredibly, Andrew Johnson. President Kennedy himself had a good chuckle about this; after all the adulation and public frenzy, Eisenhower would now see &#x201c;how he stood before the cold eye of history&#x2014;way below Truman; even below Hoover.&#x201d;5<br> <br>Indeed Camelot almost killed Ike. Not only did Kennedy run a brilliant campaign for president in 1960, contrasting his youth and dynamism with the septuagenarian Eisenhower, but his tragically shortened life only enhanced the sense of his sparkling singularity. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who had served as special assistant to JFK, rushed out an elegiac account of the Kennedy presidency. In his 1965 testament, A Thousand Days, Schlesinger used the complacent Eisenhower as a foil to better reflect sunlight upon the glittering years of Camelot. In every respect the comparison between the two men and the ideas that inspired them was unflattering to Eisenhower.6<br> <br>By the time of his death, on March 28, 1969, at the age of 78, Eisenhower had been largely forgotten by the press. Obituaries summed him up as a worthy man whose greatest role had been played on the European stage in the Second World War and whose presidency was a postscript to a life of noble military achievement. The New York Times asserted that as president he &#x201c;had governed effectively through sheer force of his popularity among average Americans&#x201d;&#x2014;a distinctly backhanded appraisal. Time magazine commented that many Americans would remember Ike &#x201c;not as the 34th president whose stewardship may long be disputed, but as &#x2018;the soldier of peace&#x2019; who led the greatest alliance of armies the world has ever seen.&#x201d; By the close of his years in office, Time concluded, he was &#x201c;more figurehead than president&#x201d; and &#x201c;out of touch with his people.&#x201d; As a politician Eisenhower seemed destined to be written off as a benign mediocrity.7<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Tides, once having ebbed, always come back in. The revival of interest in Eisenhower began in the late 1960s, prodded perhaps by the deep national crisis that his successors, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon, had confronted and exacerbated. In an era of student protest, war in Vietnam, racial upheaval, and economic malaise, the 1950s began to look curiously alluring. One of his most acerbic critics, the shrewd New York Post columnist Murray Kempton, penned a 1967 essay that almost single-handedly gave rise to a new school of thought about Eisenhower. He was neither benign nor mediocre, Kempton concluded, but malevolent and brilliant. His skills ran not to governing but to manipulation, dissimulation, and guile. He sought always to profit from the success of others and to avoid the taint of any failures, especially his own. Eisenhower was &#x201c;cold,&#x201d; &#x201c;immoral,&#x201d; determined to conceal &#x201c;his marvelous intelligence from admirer and critic alike.&#x201d; Kempton summed up Eisenhower&#x2019;s political motto: &#x201c;Always pretend to be stupid; then when you have to show yourself to be smart, the display has the additional effect of surprise.&#x201d;8<br> <br>The theme of a devious and effortlessly political Eisenhower appeared in Garry Wills&#x2019;s masterful 1970 study of the early Nixon, in which &#x201c;the Great One&#x201d; was the perfect contrast to the restless, insecure, and nakedly ambitious Nixon. The relationship hinged upon Nixon&#x2019;s desire to supplant Eisenhower and his awareness that he never could. Eisenhower&#x2019;s supreme self-confidence, his immense popularity, his ability to compel others to serve him while never appearing to ask for such loyalty&#x2014;all these were mysteries of character Nixon could never hope to understand, let alone emulate. Eisenhower, Wills believed, &#x201c;had the true professional&#x2019;s instinct for making things look easy. He appeared to be performing less work than he actually did. And he wanted it that way. An air of ease inspires confidence.&#x201d; It was in Nixon Agonistes that a leading intellectual of the era first called Eisenhower a &#x201c;political genius&#x201d;&#x2014;a far cry from the smirks and chortles of the Camelot clan.9<br> <br>The picture really began to change, though, in the late 1970s, when the voluminous archives held at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas, became available to scholars. In a 1982 book titled The Hidden-Hand Presidency, political scientist Fred Greenstein added depth and detail to the sketch offered by Kempton and Wills. Drawing on new evidence, Greenstein argued that Eisenhower&#x2019;s apparent aloofness and absenteeism had been part of a deliberate governing strategy. Greenstein believed that Ike hid his abilities and his own engagement with the issues in order to exercise power more effectively. He used intermediaries to do his political dirty work, baffled reporters with garbled syntax, refused to publicly acknowledge political rivals by name, delegated responsibility to cabinet secretaries, and fed the public reasoned, calm, simple bromides about the American way of life. &#x201c;Eisenhower went to great lengths,&#x201d; Greenstein concluded, &#x201c;to conceal the political side of his leadership.&#x201d;10<br> <br>A &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; Eisenhower, then. Perhaps. But later work, drawing on much more material than Greenstein could access, suggested otherwise. During the 1980s and 1990s the boom in Eisenhower studies gained momentum, sustained not principally by biographers but by historians of U.S. foreign relations. Scholars who wanted to know about the origins and course of the cold war; the Korean War; the rise of covert operations and the CIA; grand strategy and nuclear weapons; American policies toward China, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East; the rise of the Third World&#x2014;all trekked to Abilene to inspect the Eisenhower archives in hopes of finding hitherto unseen treasures. The subsequent cascade of studies on Eisenhower&#x2019;s cold war policies shattered forever the myth that Ike was disengaged from the running of government. And it became increasingly difficult to sustain the idea that he &#x201c;hid&#x201d; his power and authority.11<br> <br>The Eisenhower era suddenly looked, well, interesting. The new research revealed a complex president who at times showed exceptional restraint in the use of America&#x2019;s power but who also had a taste for daring and even recklessness, especially when ordering the use of covert operations against left-wing governments. The documents portrayed a deeply engaged leader struggling to forge policies in a vast array of fields, from civil rights to economic policy, infrastructure, science and education, religion, communist &#x201c;subversion&#x201d; on the home front, and national security policy abroad. Eisenhower now appeared principled but adaptive, ideological at times but usually pragmatic, a problem-solver who dominated his cabinet, the military, and the bureaucracy and put his imprimatur on the age.12<br> <br>Above all, the evidence showed how hard Ike worked over eight years. The allegation that he had been a golf-playing no-show was deeply unfair. &#x201c;No man on Earth knows what this job is all about,&#x201d; he said one afternoon in 1954. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pound, pound, pound. Not only is your intellectual capacity taxed to the utmost, but your physical stamina.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t so easy after all.13<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>This book stands on the shoulders of the many previous Eisenhower scholars who have worked diligently for years to unearth the secrets of the period and to flesh out our understanding of the man and his era. It also benefits from many newly declassified documents that have become available only recently, thanks to the efforts of the dedicated staff at the Eisenhower Library. Taking into account all this material, this book offers a comprehensive account of the president and his times and concludes with a decisive verdict: Dwight Eisenhower must be counted among the most consequential presidents of modern American history.14<br> <br>Eisenhower shaped the United States in at least three lasting ways. First, he dramatically expanded the power and scope of the 20th-century warfare state and put into place a long-term strategy designed to wage, and win, the cold war.

Combining scientific research with inspiring anecdotes from her decades of clinical practice, Satter challenges the conventional belief that parents must get overweight children to eat less and exercise more. In the long run, she says, making them go hungry and forcing them to be active makes children preoccupied with food, prone to overeating, turned off to activity, and likely to gain too much weight. Trust is a central theme here: children must be able to trust parents to provide as much food as they need to satisfy their appetites; parents must trust children to eat only as much as they need. Satter provides compelling evidence that, if parents do their jobs with respect to feeding, children are remarkably capable of knowing how much to eat.</p><p>MORE ABOUT ELLYN SATTER <p>Ellyn Satter, MS, RD, LCSW, BCD is an internationally recognized authority on eating and feeding. A family therapist and feeding and eating specialist, Satter has a private psychotherapy practice in Madison, Wisconsin. Her books, journal and magazine articles, teaching materials, seminars and media interviews have made her well-known to the lay public, professionals and the media as the leading authority on nutrition and feeding of infants and children of all ages. </p><p>Satter's stated mission is to revolutionize feeding and eating. Her unconventional advice? Do what comes naturally. "As long as adults do their jobs with feeding, children do a good job with eating. They intuitively eat the right amount of food to grow well. They naturally push themselves along to learn to like new foods. We did too, at one time. We did, that is, until it was educated out of us by well-meaning adults and misguided, puritanical rules about eating." Satter knows whereof she speaks, given her 40 years&#x2019; experience helping people of all ages with their eating and with feeding their children. </p><p>Satter's clear and vivid explanations of normal and distorted eating and feeding have made her a popular interviewee and speaker. The author of the Division of Responsibility in Feeding (parents are responsible for the what, when and where of feeding, children are responsible for the how much and whether of eating), Satter has led nutrition, health and mental health professionals as well as the general public to adopt wise and emotionally healthy approaches to feeding and eating. </p><p>Satter's books are valued by both professional and lay readers as authoritative, practical, humorous and entertaining. Your Child&#x2019;s Weight: Helping Without Harming (Kelcy Press) recommends solving the problem of children overweight throughout the growing-up years by "doing the opposite of what seems right...feeding children rather than restricting them." Child of Mine: Feeding with Love and Good Sense (Bull Publishing) helps parents observe and understand their children and translate that insight into good feeding. Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family (Kelcy Press) teaches fast, efficient, delicious and nutritious food management for the "thinking cook."

Beginning with the British Expeditionary force holding the line at the Battle of Mons in 1914 and concluding with the Battle of Easting in 1991 during Desert Storm, <i>Margin of Victory</i> teases out a connection between these battles and teaches its readers an important lesson about how future battles can be won. <br></p><p>Emphasizing military strategy, force design, and modernization, Macgregor links each of these seemingly isolated battles thematically. At the core of his analysis, the author reminds the reader that to be successful, military action must always be congruent with national culture, geography, and scientific-industrial capacity. He theorizes that strategy and geopolitics are ultimately more influential than ideology. Macgregor stresses that if nation-states want to be successful, they must accept the need for and the inevitability of change. The five warfighting dramas in this book, rendered in vivid detail by lively prose, offer many lessons on the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war.</p></p><p>Col. Douglas Macgregor USA (Ret.) is a decorated combat veteran with a PhD in international relations from the University of Virginia. He is the author of five books and is the executive vice president of Burke-Macgregor Group LLC, a defense and foreign policy consulting firm in Northern Virginia."Macgregor makes many profound recommendations based on significant historical evidence. This is a must-read for strategic leaders seeking ideas on military reform. In what I have read about future strategy and the defense innovation (including the Third Offset), few to none of Macgregor's proposals are being considered. The focus is on technology improvements--mostly in regard to ISR and autonomous systems--and not the fundamental changes Macgregor champions. They deserve serious consideration." -- <b>Joint Force Quarterly</b><br><br>"Douglas Macgregor's latest book combines masterful campaign studies and thoughtful analysis of their long-term implications for today's military establishments." - <i><b>The Journal of Military History</b></i><br><br>"This book is most highly recommended to all.... With America's Army (and sister services) engaged in heavy debate and frenzied activity on what we need to face the unknowable future, reflected in the activation of the new Army Futures Command, Multi-Domain Operations, the inception of Space Command, and the impact of the new realm of cyber warfare to name a few, Doug Macgregor has continued to offer us more than food for thought. Indeed, he may well have his fingers firmly on the pulse of what we must do to succeed, coupled with an insight and level of experience shared by few." --<i><b>Public Intelligence Blog</b></i><br><br>"The challenge is for a nation's military system to successfully adapt to changes in warfare. Although seemingly disparate, these battles are linked together with a logical theme, which makes for an informative and thought-provoking work." -- <i><b>Military Heritage</b></i><br><br>"In <i>Margin of Victory,</i> Macgregor includes the Battle of Mons in 1914, the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, The Red Army's destruction of Germany's Army Group Center in 1944, the Israeli Defense Force's counter-attack across the Suez Canal in 1973, and the Battle of '73 Easting in 1991. The reason for the selection of these battles is that each shows the imbalance between victor and vanquished had roots in the reforms that the victorious side enacted well before the war began. Macgregor wants the U.S. to begin a serious study of what it lacks in dealing with 21st century war in order to avoid finding out too late that its solutions are not adequate to provide victory." -- <i><b>U.S. Military History Review</b></i><br><br>"What does it take to win a war? West Pointer, combat leader, and renowned military thinker Douglas Macgregor answers that question in this engaging look at five major battles during the last century of combat: Mons 1914, Shanghai 1937, Belorussia 1944, Suez 1973, and Iraq 1991. You may not yet know much about these great clashes, but when you read this book, you will. More than that, you'll know just what it takes to fight and win."<b>--Lt. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger, USA (Ret.), author of <i>Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars</i></b><br><br>"Douglas Macgregor has a brave tank commander's perspective on modern warfare and a restless refusal to accept the status quo when soldiers must pay for their officers' lack of higher critical thinking or preparation for combat. By revisiting five major battles of the past hundred years he shows in moving detail how a mixture of foresight and failure to plan ahead impacted the fates not only of soldiers' lives, but of whole nations. A salutary--and wonderfully readable--lesson for us all today."<b>--Nigel Hamilton, author of <i>The Mantle of Command: FDR at War, 1941&#x2012;1942</i></b><br><br>"<i>Margin of Victory</i> is a worthy read with several well-considered recommendations that will prompt critical thinking and debate among senior military leaders and others in the defense community about how we fight--and what it might take to win the next war."<b><i>--Parameters</i></b><br><br>"All told, however, Macgregor has written another powerful critique of the American way of planning and developing strategy for war. His lesson for policy makers and strategists alike is that 'whenever new military concepts and technologies appear, the complex interaction of national culture, bureaucratic interests, and economic power does not automatically work to support them. . . .[W]hen conditions change and the margin of victory suddenly narrows, frailties and vulnerabilities concealed from view inside the armed forces . . . suddenly produce catastrophic failure.' He asserts that Washington needs to focus on its long-standing and still primary strategic concern, namely, prevention of a hostile power from dominating the Eurasian lands. He argues that the American military must increase its force levels, notably those of the Army. And he advocates for the creation of what he terms a 'national defense staff' (in other words, a general staff) 'to guide the application of American military power,' encompassing integrated capabilities across service lines."<b><i>--Naval War College Review</i></b><br><br>"Macgregor opines that the United States has foolishly taken on the role of 'global policeman,' and that in the modern environment the resources for an American margin of victory are 'thinner than ever.' Faulty decisions by policy makers, organizing for the last war instead of the next, and failing to heed changes in technology are all pitfalls that can lessen the margin of victory. The case studies presented here have been carefully researched, are well written and expertly analyzed. Whether or not they support Macgregor's thesis of current shortsighted American defense policy is left to the reader's judgment."<b><i>--Journal of America's Military Past</i></b></p><h2>The Big Bad Fox</h2><p><p>Who&#x2019;s afraid of the Big Bad Fox?

But no one is intimidated by him, least of all the hens&#x2015;when he picks a fight with one, he always ends up on the losing end. Even the wolf, the most fearsome beast of the forest, can&#x2019;t teach him how to be a proper predator. It looks like the fox will have to spend the rest of his life eating turnips.</p><p>But then the wolf comes up with the perfect scheme. If the fox steals some eggs, he could hatch the chicks himself and raise them to be a plump, juicy chicken dinner. Unfortunately, this plan falls apart when three adorable chicks hatch and call the fox Mommy.</p><p>Beautifully rendered in watercolor by Benjamin Renner, <i>The</i> <i>Big Bad Fox</i> is a hilarious and surprisingly tender parable about parenthood that's sure to be a hit with new parents (and their kids too).</p></p><p><b>Benjamin Renner</b> is an award-winning French cartoonist, animator, and filmmaker. He received a 2014 Academy Awards nomination in the category of Best Animated Feature for the film <i>Ernest &amp; Celestine</i>. His comic <i>Le grand mechant renard </i>(<i>The Big Bad Fox</i>)<i> </i>is currently being made into an animated special.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;The proverbial fox may be a menace to the henhouse&#x2014;but not the hero of this work. The titular character lacks gumption, guile, or cunning, and the chickens send him running each time he ventures into the farmyard. Taking pity on the fox, the wolf proposes playing the long game: stealing eggs and eventually eating the hatched chickens. The fox successfully makes off with the eggs, but things get complicated when the chicks emerge and (surprise, surprise!) assume that the fox is their mother. Though this work is similar in look and tone to typical comic strips (bulging-eyed, caricaturelike characters with exaggerated expressions; occasional slapstick violence; motion lines), there's a sophistication to the art that recalls the author/illustrator's roots as a celebrated filmmaker and cartoonist. Renner sets the individual scenes against a white backdrop, free of borders, resulting in a clean design, and the use of color, texture, and shading is top-notch. While much of the humor derives from somewhat predictable setups, such as the fox's botched attempts at proving that he can be just as intimidating as the wolf, it's sure to tickle young funny bones, and the author injects the narrative with a sly, edgy sensibility that sets this title apart from more typical fare.

In this second edition, veteran congregational consultant and minister Dan Hotchkiss updates the book to reflect today&#x2019;s church and synagogue landscape and shares practical insights based on his work with readers of the first edition.<br><br>Governance and Ministry highlights the importance of reaching the right governance model for a congregation to fulfill its mission&#x2014;to achieve both the outward results and the inward quality of life to which it is called. Hotchkiss draws on governance research from business, non-profits, and churches, as well as deep experience in a variety of denominations and congregations to help readers determine the governance model that best fits their needs. The second edition has been streamlined and reorganized to better help readers think through leadership models and the process of change. The book features new material on the implications of congregation size, the process of governance change, policy choices, and the lay-clergy relationship. It also features two appendices with resources often requested by Hotchkiss&#x2019;s consulting clients: a style guide for policy-makers and a unified example of a board policy book.<br><br>Written with energy and humor, and offering plenty of practical examples, the second edition of this helpful resource is ideal for anyone involved in church leadership to assist in framing critical questions, creating a vision, and implementing a plan.</p><p>Dan Hotchkiss writes, consults, and speaks widely for congregations and other nonprofits. His specialties include board governance, strategic and financial planning, clergy transition, and fundraising. As a senior consultant for the Alban Institute for fourteen years, and now as an independent consultant, Dan has directly helped hundreds of congregations and related organizations in more than thirty denominational groups. Through his coaching, teaching, and writing, Dan touches the lives of an even wider range of leaders. He is also the author of Ministry and Money: A Guide for Clergy and Their Friends. His website is www.danhotchkiss.com.For years, I have been recommending to congregational leaders that they read Dan Hotchkiss&#x2019; outstanding book Governance and Ministry.... Thus, I was delighted to hear that Hotchkiss recently updated, expanded and refined his thinking on governance in a second edition of Governance and Ministry. It may be a second edition, but it reads like a totally new book. The first six chapters will be familiar to readers of the first book. However, even in these chapters, Hotchkiss has refined them based on his work with congregations implementing the strategies for governance he made in the first edition. It felt like new reading to me. In the next five chapters, Hotchkiss adds totally new material along with several very practical, helpful appendices.... Having read the second edition of this classic book, I am convinced that it will have a similar level of success in helping pastors and church members alike understand their roles as well as the difference between governing and doing ministry. (<i>The Presbyterian Outlook</i>)<br><br>I used the first edition with the governing board of The Episcopal Church several years ago, and it helped to clarify the difference between policy-making and management functions. This second edition adds a good deal, and will be helpful for boards and members in religious bodies, nonprofits, and community organizations. I commend this as a learning and leading tool for committed members, all of whom are called to some form of leadership and transformation, including governance. (The Most Reverend Katharine Jefferts Schori, presiding bishop and primate, the Episcopal Church)<br><br>The first edition of Dan&#x2019;s book has proven invaluable to numerous congregations of all sizes, in all denominations. But this second edition is more than an upgrade. It offers new coaching that is crucial for successful organizational change. Here is detailed information about how churches change their governance model; how to deal with the stress of change; and how congregational life is positively different afterwards. Much of the decline of churches has nothing to do with theology, ideology, or tradition. It has everything to do with tedious, tentative, exhausting, and ineffective decision-making in a world of fast-paced change and exploding diversity. Organizational change is more urgent than ever. This book will not only help you do it&#x2014;it will make you glad you did. (Thomas G. Bandy, author; director of Thriving Church Consulting)<br><br>Dan Hotchkiss has taught me most of what I know about effective governance in congregations. Dan's winsome writing style brings the topic of governance to life in this latest edition. This book should be on the short &#x2018;go to&#x2019; resource list of every congregational leader. (Susan Beaumont, author of Inside the Large Congregation)<br><br>Have you felt swamped by the myriad of possible ways to organize, govern, and manage a church? Has the relationship of leadership issues among church boards, committees, clergy and congregation mystified you? Or does the mounting bibliography of potential ways to govern religious organizations overwhelm you? Dan Hotchkiss has seen it all&#x2014;has been there and done that in his organizing work of holy conversations with many churches. He sorts out the issues and possibilities for us in this book and offers a practical and timely way to explore governance change. His approach is flexible and helpful. (Charles M. Olsen, author of Discerning God's Will Together and Transforming Church Boards into Communities of Spiritual Leaders)<br><br>Dan Hotchkiss is a premier church planning facilitator. Thus, his words in this book take on a sense of depth and authority. He knows whereof he speaks. Hotchkiss articulates a methodology by which local churches can be energized and visionary not &#x2018;in spite of&#x2019; old ways of doing business but &#x2018;because of&#x2019; new ones. (Michael Brown, senior minister, Marble Collegiate Church, New York, New York)<br><br>If our faith is held as a 'treasure in earthen vessels' then it matters deeply how we use those vessels called congregations. Board, staff, and members need to fulfill their critical roles and align appropriately for mission. Dan Hotchkiss helps. He provides a rich mix of ideas, language, models, and steps to help congregations use leadership well. And Dan writes like he talks&#x2014;engagingly, with wisdom, and skirted with humor. It&#x2019;s good.

Daily Prayer for All Seasons offers a variation on that theme, where a complete service covers one or two pages, thereby eliminating the need to shuffle prayer books and hymnals. Daily Prayer for All Seasons works for individuals, small groups, and/or congregations. This prayer book presents a variety of images of God, uses inclusive and expansive language for and about God, and presents a rich variety of language, including poetry, meditation, and prayers from the broader community of faith. <br> For all Episcopalians - and others - interested in the daily office and praying the hours.&nbsp;<br> <br> <p>Episcopalians are bound together by prayer, and when we draw those prayers from our diverse traditions and cultures, we come closer to the heart of God. "Daily Prayer for All Seasons" gives us prayers, poems and meditations in many voices to mark the hours of the day and the seasons of the year. I am grateful to the leaders from across the Episcopal Church who have collaborated on this important new set of prayers for everyday life. &nbsp;</p> <p>--The Rev. Gay Clark Jennings, president, House of Deputies of The Episcopal Church</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A call to prayer that sounds through the hours of our days and nights, revealing God with us as the seasons turn.

Romero is the author of dozens of books, including the National Geographic Reader biography <i>Ibn al-Haytham: The Man Who Discovered How We See</i>.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;This slim volume acquaints beginning readers with the life and times of Ibn al-Haytham (also known as Alhazen), an Arab scholar who was a key figure in the history and study of optics. Arranged in 10 short chapters, the book introduces readers to the golden age of Muslim civilization and al-Haytham's turbulent life and optical discoveries. Students will learn how he feigned madness to escape a bad-tempered caliph; spent 10 years under house arrest; made discoveries about light; invented an early version of the camera obscura; and developed the first example of the scientific method in The Book of Optics. Colorful images appear on every page: a mix of period paintings and drawings and modern-day photographs. "In His Words" and "That's a Fact" boxes are included throughout to reinforce main ideas. Definitions for new vocabulary words are highlighted in a "Words To Know" box. These same terms are also included in a picture glossary at the end of the narrative. A brief multiple-choice quiz will test readers' knowledge.

Designed both as a reference book and as a vivid history in its own right, this text describes how various European powers grappled with and sought to exploit the advent of new technology and tactics upon the high seas. <br><br> Written in the late 19th century, Mahan's accounts span some of the most pivotal battles in naval history. The Seven Years War, whereby the English demonstrated the dominant power of the Royal Navy, would prove a turning point both in the fate of that nation's Empire, and the manner in which sea power was projected and relied upon around the world. <br><br> Naval events which took place in theatres of battle such as the Mediterranean, the Caribbean Sea and the Indian Ocean are described in great detail. The roles of the most distinguished admirals, commanders and ships are described, while the limits of sea power's ability to tip the scales of war - such as during the American War of Independence - are discussed. <br><br> Conversely, Mahan also examines the greatest successes of naval warfare in the era; the prevalence of coastal raiding in Spain and large scale engagements in the West Indies are exemplary of sea power's prowess. With the help of battle maps, the complex movements of the vessels in many of the major engagements are explained, with the various masterstrokes and follies of command laid bare for the judgement of the reader. <br><br> Together with the text and illustrations, this edition also includes Mahan's original notes, which are appended as endnotes at the conclusion of each chapter.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) was an American naval officer and lecturer. This highly influential volume, first published in 1890, contains Mahan&#39;s analysis and discussions of the factors leading to Britain&#39;s naval domination in the eighteenth century, with strategic and tactical recommendations based on these factors.<p>"Captain Mahan has written distinctively the best and most important, and also by far the most interesting, book on naval history which has been produced on either side of the water for many a long year." <br>--Atlantic Monthly <br>October 1890</p><p>First published over a century ago, this classic text on the history and tactics of naval warfare had a profound effect on the training of officers and the deployment of naval resources around the globe. Many of the world's great military strategists since 1890 have avidly read this book, including both Franklin Delano and Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and a host of admirals, chancellors, prime ministers, kings, and other presidents. It continues to be a primary reference for naval students and historians.</p><p>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783 presents the argument that, despite great changes and scientific advances in naval weaponry, certain principles of naval strategy remain constant. Beginning in the time of Alexander the Great, those nations with strong commercial and military command of the seas were the nations of greatest strength, wealth, and power. Though the determinants of military supremacy and the global balance of power have changed due to tremendous advances in technology, the principles and strategies discussed in the book remain creditable. The extensive presentation of the history of high-seas navigation alone makes this book an invaluable resource, as it has been credited with stimulating the growth of modern navies in leading countries of the world.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) served in the Civil War and twice served as the president of the United States Naval War College, beginning shortly after the college was founded. Mahan became known as one of the leading spokesmen for the age of American imperialism. In addition to his books on the history of naval warfare, he wrote biographies of David Farragut and Horatio Nelson.</p></p><h2>The Life God Blesses: Weathering The Storms Of Life That Threaten The Soul</h2><p>In <i>The Life God Blesses,</i> author and pastor Gordon MacDonald asks the question, are we prepared to weather the storms of life?

She is a professor of psychology and social work at Empire State College. Prior to becoming a therapist she worked in television and theater as both a performer and producer. She has two daughters and lives in New York with her husband, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Michael D&#39;Antonio.<p>Her husband, a white-haired man dressed in khaki pants and a flannel shirt, was small, alert and quite fit. He had pushed her wheelchair with relative ease and then knelt next to her. He pushed back the sleeve of his shirt, revealing a very old tattoo of a buxom young woman - maybe it was Betty Grable - and stroked his wife's hair. As he adjusted the plastic tubing for her oxygen supply, he spoke softly in his wife's ear. Whatever he said made her smile. <br> <br> As I peeked over my magazine I became strangely jealous. Here she was, at the end of her life, physically debilitated and struggling. But she was not shy or embarrassed. Instead, she exuded a peaceful sense of certainty about who she was and her inherent value. It was clear that her husband adored her and cherished every moment they spent together. I considered his tattoo and thought of the time when he was young and probably quite obsessed with pretty women. And who knows, maybe his wife was once the girl who had fulfilled his fantasy. But in the moment I witnessed, what he loved was the true and essential person inside the body, the invisible beauty he may not have seen in younger years.</p> <p>In the weeks after seeing that couple in the doctor's office I struggled to understand why I had been so envious. I had a husband who loved me. I felt good about my work and about my two children, Amy and Elizabeth. But I felt, deep in my heart, there was something that older woman possessed that I wanted. It was there in her face, and in the way she interacted with her husband, but I just couldn't name it. <br> <br> The answers we need often come to us at unpredictable moments and from surprising sources. This happened to me on a summer evening as I prepared dinner. I was in the kitchen, taking vegetables out of the refrigerator and grabbing pots and pans from the cupboard while my daughters sat together reading on the sofa in the next room. Elizabeth, age six, was reading to two-year-old Amy. Amy had her favorite blanket in her hand, her best bear, Lauren, in her lap and her thumb in her mouth. Elizabeth's stuffed bear, Ted, was propped next to her. They had reached page sixteen of The Velveteen Rabbit, Margery Williams's story, which was one of their favorites.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>What is REAL asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. </em><em>"Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"<br> </em><em><br> "Real isn't how you are made," said the Skin Horse. "It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."<br> </em><em><br> "Does it hurt?"</em></p> <p><em>"Sometimes," said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. "When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."</em></p> <p><em>"Does it happen all at once," he asked, "or bit by bit?"</em></p> <p><em>"It doesn't happen all at once," said the Skin Horse. "You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But those things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."</em></p> </blockquote><p>In the kitchen, I was suddenly flooded with emotion and understanding. The Rabbit and the Skin Horse, I realized, were talking about the difference between superficial beauty and the kind of Real, inner beauty that we all possess as unique human beings. They were saying that in a life well-lived, where we are true to ourselves, all the struggles and challenges only make us more Real and more loveable. Others can see this quality in us, and make us even more Real with their love and nurturing.<br> <br> At last I understood my reaction to the older woman at my doctor's office. She was loose in the joints. Her hair was thinning, and her clothes were shabby. But she showed no anxiety, no shame, no worry. She accepted herself fully. She knew she was precious and irreplaceable. She was Real. She loved and accepted herself as a Real, and therefore imperfect, person.<br> <br> The scene at the doctor's office was made all the more poignant by the fact that the woman's Real value was clear to her husband as well. To him she could never be ugly, because she was simply herself. At a moment when anyone else might have been supremely self-conscious, he was so Real that he was almost carefree. He had thoroughly overcome the superficial attitude reflected in his old tattoo and come to adore his wife for her deepest, inner self. <br> <br> As the pages of The Velveteen Rabbit turn, the main characters teach us how to find the peace that comes when we focus on what matters most in life: love, relationships, and empathy for ourselves and others. The Skin Horse is a wise and experienced elder who is generous with what he has learned. The Rabbit is, like all of us, insecure and searching for his place in the world, a place he eventually finds in a rather unexpected new life. </p> <p>As in so many children's books, the human beings in Margery Williams's tale are mostly oblivious to the intense drama affecting the toys in the nursery. In this case, the little Velveteen Rabbit stays with his owner - the Boy - as he suffers through scarlet fever. When the Boy recovers, the doctor insists that the bunny - "a mass of scarlet fever germs!" - be replaced. Though the Rabbit is discarded, it is not the end of the story. As he lies in the yard waiting to be burned with the trash, the Rabbit is transformed from a toy that was Real only to the Boy into an actual living creature who is Real for all to see. He hops off to live a splendid life with other Real rabbits, who become his friends. The words of the Skin Horse, who was wise, secure and content, are proven true. Being Real transforms us.<br> <br> Out in the living room, Elizabeth and Amy paused and looked at their own stuffed animals. Elizabeth's bear, Ted, was missing an eye. The white fur of Amy's bear was dingy gray. Its pink thread nose was a little ragged. The two stuffed animals had both been loved so much, and so deeply, that the girls agreed that they must be Real. What was so obvious to my young daughters - that you don't have to be perfect to be worthy - was a revelation to me. </p> <p><strong>A Realistic Point of View </strong></p> <p>Over the next few weeks I noticed that the message of The Velveteen Rabbit had stirred some long-standing and painful feelings. Even though my life was good, at least as other people might measure it, I didn't posses the confidence, the completeness, the self-awareness of that woman in the wheelchair. As a young woman, mother, wife and professional, I was filled with insecurity and self-doubt. Every day I wore the facade of being sure of myself, but deep inside, I wasn't sure of anything. I wasn't completely Real. </p></p><h2>Thinking Body, Dancing Mind: Taosports for Extraordinary Performance in Athletics, Business, and Life</h2><p>Written by a sports psychologist and a renowned T&#39;ai Chi master, here is a guide to enriching all of life&#39;s pursuits through the practice of its simple mental tools and wisdom. Using stories of success from athletes and businesspeople, the authors present techniques and exercises to promote relaxation and enhance performance.</p><p><b>Chungliang Al Huang</b> is the founder-president of Living Tao Foundation and the director of Lan Ting Institute. An internationally recognized Tai Ji master and authority of East/West cultural synthesis, he has been a research fellow at the Academia Sinica and a member of the World Academy of Art and Science. He is the author of the bestselling classic <i>Embrace Tiger</i>, <i>Return to Mountain,</i> and <i>Quantum Soup: Fortune Cookies in Crisis</i>, and coauthor with Alan Watts of <i>Tao: The Watercourse Way</i>.<br><br><b>Jerry Lynch, PhD,</b> counseling psychologist and international speaker, is also a corporate consultant and author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Living Beyond Limits</i>&nbsp;and, with&nbsp;Chungliang Al Huang,&nbsp;<i>Thinking Body, Dancing Mind</i>.AWAKENING TO THE TAO<br> &nbsp;<br> The title of this book, Thinking Body, Dancing Mind, embodies a classic Tao paradox. It immediately encourages us to think differently by juxtaposing opposites. Ancient Taoist master-teachers often used paradox and metaphor to open up their students&#x2019; minds to new ideas, new awareness, and profound understandings of deep forces and unseen interconnections. Does the body, indeed, think? It does when you cease to interfere with its deep-seated intelligence, known as instinct or intuitive physical response. Does the mind dance? It does when you free it to flow with life&#x2019;s natural processes, when you loosen your tendency toward critical judgment and control. A dancing mind is relaxed, visionary, and open to the full range of human possibility. &#x201c;Thinking body, dancing mind&#x201d; means that you have within you all that you need to be and to do anything you wish. The new attitudes and beliefs presented in this book will help you accomplish your goals and enjoy yourself in the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> Part I enables you to begin your transformational journey by introducing you to the Tao and the concept of TaoSport. This process will lead you to extraordinary performance in athletics, work, and life. Here are guidelines&#x2014;or TaoSports&#x2014;for visualizations and affirmations for progressing along the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> FROM WESTERN SPORTS TO TAOSPORTS<br> &nbsp;<br> I brought my son Daniel to his first organized baseball game, a Little League game, when he was at the innocent and impressionable age of five. My intention was to expose him to the wonderful excitement and joy of neophyte little leaguers and their enthusiastic, proud parents. Daniel and I were both enjoying our outing, when a routine grounder was hit to first with the bases loaded. In most cases, such a hit surely would have ended the first inning. Instead, the ball rolled through the first baseman&#x2019;s legs, and two runs scored. The subsequent behavior of the irate coach toward that vulnerable child killed Daniel&#x2019;s and my desire to participate in that league. &#x201c;Smith&#x2014; play first for Stevens!&#x201d; shouted the insensitive coach, who proceeded to embarrass the child with harsh criticism and took him out of the game.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny was shocked and confused; he wondered why anyone would want to play such a lousy game. Even at his young age, my son empathized with the boy&#x2019;s pain. What Danny couldn&#x2019;t know yet was the potential aftershock this incident could cause the heartbroken youngster, even well into adulthood: Would he ever try to play again after such humiliation? What messages about his sense of self would he internalize? What would this memory do to his confidence, self-image, fear of failure, and vision of what he could or couldn&#x2019;t do in the future? Would he ever trust another coach? Would he ever play sports free of the anxiety and tension caused by this incident?<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, this is not an unusual or isolated story. Most athletes in both individual and team sports experience from time to time tremendous pressure, fear, and anxiety generated by an overwhelming obsession to win. We learn this frame of mind from early childhood, and it is perpetuated by a competitive society that echoes with &#x201c;the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat.&#x201d; Athletic pressure is epidemic, and it spills over into other arenas of performance, particularly in the academic and corporate worlds. Such attitudes undermine the very core of our individual integrity and values.<br> &nbsp;<br> A recent Sports Illustrated interview with the president of Allegheny College, Daniel Sullivan, addressed the impact of this obsession with victory, in a most powerful denouncement of college sports. &#x201c;I cannot think of a single thing,&#x201d; he stated, &#x201c;that has eroded public confidence in America&#x2019;s colleges and universities ... more than intercollegiate athletics as it is practiced by a large faction of the universities in the NCAAs Division I and II. It is hard to teach integrity in the pursuit of knowledge or how to live a life of purpose and service, when an institution&#x2019;s own integrity is compromised in the unconstrained pursuit of victory on the playing fields.&#x201d; By contrast, the athletic department at Allegheny, he said, understands the role of sport in creating joy and fun while developing the athlete&#x2019;s potential as a human being.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Western approach to sports has given rise to questionable ethical and moral means of competition and standards of success. The use of anabolic steroids in Olympic games, professional sports, and other athletic arenas has been widespread in all countries. Violence and cheating in sport reflect the &#x201c;win at any cost&#x201d; attitude. This pressure to win has a more devastating effect on overall athletic performance than perhaps anything else. The same attitudes toward sport carry over to the world of business and everyday life, making us ineffective in those arenas of performance, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> This Western approach is also responsible for creating a number of major nonproductive, dysfunctional behavior patterns in athletes. Having worked with thousands of professional, Olympic, university, and recreational athletes, ages ten to seventy-five, I have seen how the following behavioral patterns, reinforced by our culture&#x2019;s competitive systems, stand in the way of their athletic and their personal joy, and their fulfillment and happiness in work and life in general. Most athletes today:<br> &nbsp;<br> constantly struggle for external recognition rather than internal satisfaction;<br> &nbsp;<br> measure their self-worth as an athlete or person solely on the outcome of their performances in sport, on the job, or in relationships of any kind;<br> &nbsp;<br> focus on attaining perfection in every task, instead of seeing life as a journey in search of excellence;<br> &nbsp;<br> treat their sport or goals as something to conquer, thereby expending valuable energy;<br> &nbsp;<br> have unrealistic expectations that result in frustration, disappointment, and distraction;<br> &nbsp;<br> blame others when things go wrong, and so feel out of control; and<br> &nbsp;<br> condemn themselves for their failures, setbacks, and mistakes, and so have a poor sense of self.<br> &nbsp;<br> Athletics are big business, and athletes&#x2019; well-being and health are often disregarded in the process. Athletes become statistics&#x2014;living endorsements and walking billboards for corporate sponsors. A game&#x2019;s outcome, the result&#x2014;&#x201c;Who won?&#x201d;&#x2014;has become everything, supplanting the notion that sport is about passion and love for what you&#x2019;re doing.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1908, Pierre de Coubertin declared that &#x201c;the goal of the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part.&#x201d; We seem to have gotten off track since then. Biased broadcasters during telecasts of the Olympic games, feeling a loyalty to the United States, exhibit a nationalistic bit of joy in the setbacks and mistakes of our close competitors; flags at awards ceremonies have become instruments of alienation and separateness rather than unification. The results of our overweening desire to be number one are the stresses, anxieties, drug use, and dishonesty that plague our sports and our society. Krishnamurti once said, &#x201c;War is but a spectacular expression of our everyday life.&#x201d; So is sport an expression of our lives and attitudes.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>How to Work with Angels (Pocket Guides to Practical Spirituality)</h2><p>Learn ten steps to make angels a part of your life. Whether for love, healing, protection, guidance or illumination, angels stand ready to help you in many practical and personal ways. And as Elizabeth Clare Prophet says, working with angels also puts us in touch with our higher self. &#x2015;Bodhi Tree Book Review</p><p>Elizabeth Clare Prophet (19392009) was a pioneer of modern spirituality and an internationally renowned speaker and author. Her books are published in more than 30 languages, and millions of copies have been sold online and in bookstores worldwide. Throughout her lifetime, Mrs. Prophet walked the path of spiritual adeptship, advancing through the universal initiations common to mystics of both East and West. She taught about this path and described her own experiences for the benefit of all who desire to make spiritual progress. Mrs. Prophet has left an extensive library of spiritual teachings from the ascended masters and a thriving, worldwide community of people who study and practice these teachings.MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ANGELS <p>While water-skiing on the Navesink River in New Jersey when I was eighteen, I had one of my early experiences with angels. It was a beautiful day and I was headed out toward the ocean. Suddenly I realized that I had entered another dimension. I could see not thousands but millions of angels. </p><p>I saw that they were my friends, brothers and sisters, spiritual companions. I also realized that I had a calling from God and that I would be shown what to do in order to fulfill it. And I knew that I would never be alone because the angels would always be with me. </p><p>That vision stayed with me through my college years as I searched for greater contact with the angels and other beings of light. In 1961 I met Mark Prophet, who would become both my teacher and my husband. Mark was able to receive inspired revelations from the angels and from other spiritual beings known as Ascended Masters. I realized it was also my calling to receive these revelations, which are called dictations. </p><p>Mark passed on in 1973 and I have continued his work through The Summit Lighthouse, the spiritual organization he founded. Between us, we have taken thousands of dictations, which are the source of the angel quotations and many of the prayers in this booklet. </p><p>During years of communing with the angels, I have developed a personal relationship with them. They are always near, they whisper words of warning, guidance and encouragement. I know that Archangel Michael and his blue-flame angels have saved me and my family from serious harm dozens of times. And my angel secretaries even help me to organize my days. </p><p>In the following pages you will learn how you can develop your own relationship with the angels or expand the contact that you already have with them. The angels want to be a part of your life. They are ready to help you solve problems, big and small, and bring you closer to your Higher Self. </p><p>Just follow the steps outlined here and the angels will take charge. You may not see them as they fly thick and fast about your business, but you will see the results as they respond, sometimes faster than you can ask for help! </p><p>Elizabeth Clare Prophet The Summit Lighthouse</p></p><h2>If You Ever Want to Bring a Circus to the Library, Don&#39;t!

"It taught me what I needed to know about being human but never learned in school.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking if everyone were to do Positive Manipulation for even five minutes a day, our entire world would shift!&#x201d; &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t believe you possess Soul Power, you will after reading this book. If you do believe, be prepared to be in touch with it like never before!&#x201d;My Mini Book of Mighty Mantras is a daily tool&#x2014;a way to stay physically, mentally, and emotionally in tune with our spiritual selves. Through Positive Manipulation�, we learn how to stay mindful of our own power, purpose, and potential to eradicate old mindsets, unhealthy emotions, and unproductive thoughts and habits. In the first 50 pages, scientific research is combined with known spiritual principles, giving us a better understanding of the need to take control of the energy our thoughts and emotions produce. The remaining pages include 369 messages and mantras. Called &#x2018;musings,' they are meant to help us stay centered on the core principles of life--what every faith, belief, and religion teaches about love and goodness. With one intention per day, we are taken on a minute-to-minute journey of positive mental coaxing and emotional uplifting meant to maintain our highest (and chosen) state of being. Positive Manipulation� (PM) is life-changing as it is the willful act of manipulating whatever mental, emotional, and physical energy that is not working on our behalf into the most appropriate and productive outcome we can achieve. "We do this," she says, "so we can stay as spiritually driven and connected as our human form will allow."The My Mini Book Series&#x2019; has a mascot named MantraMouse� who is featured in illustrations throughout the book. MantraMouse reminds us that the little things in life matter! Every thought we have--every emotion we allow to take over our minds, hearts, and bodies-- will create energy that resonates inside and outside of ourselves, which, by the way, can be felt by others. The author believes that our feelings will dictate our future, and if they are not in alignment with what we really want, they will hinder our ability to move forward and toward what we do want. As she puts it, &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t help but physically walk into the future we have been mentally and emotionally preparing for.&#x201d;This is not just a conglomeration of musings, though. This book offers a way to stay in tune with Higher Power/Self/Soul/Intuition. It is a must-have for every wellness-minded, spiritual individual who chooses to live the best life they can will into existence in the best body they can achieve as they put their best foot forward each new day. The author claims that being born was our gift; living life is our challenge, and being the best we can be is our choice. She says, "Irrespective of where we have ended up today, we are never beholden to our yesterdays. Every day is Anew Day! Every day offers us the ability to grow forward; to heal from past events, from illness and disease, trauma, and strife. Every day our minds can restore, rejuvenate, and re-negotiate all the cells in our bodies so we can live the day we choose to willfully step into." She asks her readers to make the decision to unravel from everything that may be holding them back. "We now have the key that unlocks the door to the subconscious," she says, "and we can heal from what is stuck there. There is no longer a reason to live a come-what-may-day. We can lead the life we choose to lead. We can be whomever and whatever we choose to be."</p><p></p><h2>Train Your Brain: How to Build a Million Dollar Business in Record Time</h2><p>&#34;Using Train Your Brain, in two years, I&#39;ve gone from zero to a million dollars a year in my business and paid off $30,000 in debt!&#34; ~ Sarah Thomas, Basehor, K.S. When Dana Wilde began her direct-sales business, she realized that education for entrepreneurs typically consisted of endless &#34;how-to&#34; explanations: how to market, how to pick up the phone, how to manage your time, how to increase bookings or sales. There always seemed to be a new system to learn, a new surefire method or cutting-edge technique for entrepreneurs to master. In an effort to teach her team members a better and easier way, Dana Wilde created Train Your Brain, a tested and proven system combining elements of both mindset and action . . . or as Dana likes to call it, Intentional Action. What Dana discovered by using Train Your Brain is that mindset can be &#34;taught&#34; and that learning simple mindset strategies not only allows you to understand how the brain works but also shows you how easy it is to change your thinking and, as a result, change your outcomes. In Train Your Brain, Dana breaks down the Cycle of Perpetual Sameness-the number one reason why most people only experience incremental change in their lives. More importantly, she also provides the much-needed blueprint to help you get off this counterproductive cycle quickly. Train Your Brain, with its twenty easy-to-implement &#34;Mindware Experiments,&#34; gives you all the necessary tools needed to get off . . . and stay off . . . the Cycle of Perpetual Sameness, so you can transform your life and grow your business in record time!</p><p>As an entrepreneur, are you using "hard work" as your method to success?<br> &nbsp;<br> Do feel like you know all the things you "should" be doing to be successful, but you don't feel like doing them?<br> &nbsp;<br> Have you hit a plateau?<br> &nbsp;<br> Would you like more consistency in your business?<br> &nbsp;<br> Do you feel like you're doing everything right, but you're not getting the same results as others?<br> &nbsp;<br> If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then Train Your Brain is for you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana Wilde used the Train Your Brain techniques to propel her to recordbreaking status in her direct-sales business, from zero to over a million dollars in sales in just nineteen months.

This is a first-class study aid that anyone could read with profit."--<b>Robert P.

His insights reflect the best findings of contemporary scholarship. Without resorting to critical technicalities, he decodes many of the secrets of the biblical text and uncovers cultural realities that throw light on otherwise obscure sayings. Though faithful to the ancient biblical message, he always has his modern readers in mind as he plumbs the depths of that message. The bibliographies that follow each chapter will only enhance the study of this often overlooked segment of the biblical tradition."--<b>Dianne Bergant, CSA</b>, Catholic Theological Union in Chicago<br><br>"Estes's <i>Handbook</i> represents an enormous amount of time and labor well spent, for which teachers and students will be grateful.

While taking advantage of the most recent scholarship on the Psalms and the wisdom writings, Estes is able to distill this information and present it in a form that is accessible to laypersons and helpful to any involved in the serious study of Scripture.

But scientists know this is no longer true. In fact, prominent researchers now say that our best and perhaps only hope of defeating Alzheimer's is to <i>prevent</i> it. <br><br>After best-selling author Jean Carper discovered that she had the major susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's, she was determined to find all the latest scientific evidence on how to escape it. She discovered 100 surprisingly simple scientifically tested ways to radically cut the odds of Alzheimer's, memory decline, and other forms of dementia.

Soft pastel is certainly the most versatile and widely used, but the modern range of materials include other pastel types that have their own specific purpose. In this exhaustive A-Z reference for artists of all skills, a variety of different pastel types are detailed, from oil through to water-soluble pastels, amongst the multitude of techniques broken down and easily explained.<br><br>The book itself is divided into two sections: the first provides step-by-step demonstrations that guide artists through a variety of techniques, from basic colour mixing through to creating special effects such as sgraffito and sfumato. The second part focuses on themes, illustrating how individual artists tackle a number of subjects, including natural landscapes, urban scenes, figures, animals and still life.</p><p>Judy Martin is a painter and teacher also known as the author of a number of practical art books. She lives and works in Brighton, on England&#39;s south coast, and exhibits in her home studio every year for the Artist&#39;s Open Houses during Brighton Festival. She studied painting and printmaking at Maidstone College of Art and went on to a two-year postgraduate degree at Reading University. She was a freelance writer and editor for a period of fifteen years, and has subsequently worked in adult education and at a mental health day centre, facilitating groups in art craft and ceramic work.This is an updated guide to what to do with those colorful sticks you see in art shops. They are for painting with but are not like paint; instead they come in a variety of different types each with their own special characteristics. Read all about it in this handy guide for artists. As it says on the back cover this book &#34;encourages artists to discover and develop their pastel painting skills&#34;. In other words this is a guide to pastels aimed at the artist who has gained their experience in other media and wants to branch out. It is not a beginners&#39; guide and although there are a few &#34;demonstrations&#34; to read through you won&#39;t find projects with staged photographic steps. Find out what each pastel type does and all about suitable papers and other materials. Learn about the different ways of using pastels and the effects each are capable of, plus how to use them in conjunction with other art media. The rest of the book looks at themes for pictures, each subject being a gallery of work with explanations about how effects were produced. Most subjects are covered from portraits of people and animals to landscapes, buildings, water and still life but not abstracts. Each of the six sections here has a demonstration by a variety of artists showing how they worked through a picture. To get the most out of this book it helps to be experienced already and thus be able to master a new medium without a primer. * myshelf.com *</p><h2>Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora</h2><p>This volume introduces black science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction writers to the generations of readers who have not had the chance to explore the scope and diversity among African-American writers.</p><p>Dark matter: the nonluminous matter, not yet detected, that nonetheless has detectable gravitational effects on the universe.<p> Dark matter: the Afro-American presence and influences unseen or unacknowledged by Euro-American culture. </p><p> <i>Dark Matter</i>: the first anthology to illuminate the presence and influence of black writers in speculative fiction, with 25 stories, three novel excerpts, and five essays.</p><p> This anthology's critical and historical importance is indisputable. But that's not why it will prove to be the best anthology of 2000 in both the speculative and the literary fiction fields. It's because the stories are great: entertaining, imaginative, insightful, sharply characterized, and beautifully written. The earliest story in <i>Dark Matter</i> is acclaimed literary author Charles W. Chesnutt's "The Goophered Grapevine" (1887), in which an aging ex-slave tells a chilling tale of cursed land to a white Northerner buying a Southern plantation. In "The Comet" (1920), W.E.B. Du Bois portrays the rich white woman and the poor black man who may be the only survivors of an astronomical near-miss. In George S. Schuyler's "Black No More" (1931), an excerpt from the satirical novel of the same name, an African American scientist invents a machine that can turn blacks white. More recent reprints include science fiction master Samuel R. Delany's Nebula Award-winning "Aye, and Gomorrah..." (1967), which delineates the socio-sexual effects of asexual astronauts; Charles R. Saunders's heroic fantasy "Gimmile's Songs" (1984), in which a woman warrior encounters a singer with a frightening, compelling magic in ancient West Africa; MacArthur Genius Grant recipient Octavia E. Butler's powerful "The Evening and the Morning and the Night" (1987), in which the cure for cancer creates a terrifying new disease of compulsive self-mutilation; and Derrick Bell's angry, riveting "The Space Traders" (1992), in which aliens offer to trade their advanced technology to the U.S. in exchange for its black population. Other reprints include "Ark of Bones" (1974) by author-poet-folklorist Henry Dumas; "Future Christmas" (1982) by master satirist Ishmael Reed; "Rhythm Travel" (1996) by playwright-poet-critic Amiri Baraka (who has also written as LeRoi Jones and Imamu Amiri Baraka); and "The African Origins of UFOs" (2000) by London-based West Indian author Anthony Joseph.</p><p> Most of the stories in <i>Dark Matter</i> are original; these range even more widely in their concerns and themes. In the generation ship of Linda Addison's "Twice, at Once, Separated," a Yanomami Indian tribe preserves its culture in coexistence with technology, while visions tear a young woman from her own wedding. Bestselling novelist Steven Barnes examines degrees of privilege and deprivation when an African American woman artist is trapped in an African concentration camp in his unflinching contribution, "The Woman in the Wall." In John W. Campbell Award winner Nalo Hopkinson's sexy, scary "Ganger (Ball Lightning)," two lovers drifting apart try to reconnect through the separation of virtual sex. A mystic power awakens in the devastated future of Ama Patterson's gorgeous and tough "Hussy Strutt." An artist's infidelity changes two generations in Leone Ross's astute, magic-realist "Tasting Songs." In Nisi Shawl's sharp, witty mythic fantasy "At the Huts of Ajala," the spirit of a modern woman must outwit a god before she is even born. Others contributing new stories are Tananarive Due, Robert Fleming, Jewelle Gomez, Akua Lezli Hope, Honor�e Fanonne Jeffers, Kalamu ya Salaam, Kiini Ibura Salaam, Evie Shockley, and Darryl A.

He was recently named one of <i>People</i> magazine&#x2019;s Sexiest Men Alive.In his follow up to his ALA award-winning self-help Letters to a Young Brother, actor and author Harper uses an epistolary format, interrupted by youth-centric digressions, to capture the hearts and minds of his audience, young women. Each chapter is a letter beginning with an uplifting quote and post-scripted with a question posed via email (the formatting is lifted whole) and answered by a famous, successful woman like Nikki Giovanni, Michelle Obama, Ruby Dee and Eve. Writing in a conversational style, Harper focuses on a variety of different issues loosely grouped into topics like blues, love, family relationships, saving money and appreciating life (though not overly religious, Harper isn't shy with his beliefs). Chapters are short and focused, and though Harper's approach is framed as a "Black man to Black woman," his gracious, uplifting text is suitable for any young woman looking for perspective; his advice is nothing new, but it is genuine and accessible. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This clearly written, illustrated guide addresses that need, emphasizing conventional septic systems powered by gravity flow, filtering through soil, and the natural soil organisms that purify sewage. The book discusses maintenance, what to do if things go wrong, and alternative systems such as mounds and sand filters. Additional chapters cover graywater systems, composting toilets, and a unique history of water-borne waste disposal. This expanded edition contains three new chapters.</p><p>What Its About <p>An Unheralded Wonder </p><p>The gravity-powered septic system is a wonder of technology past and present. Its operation is so quiet, natural, and energy-free that we tend to forget the vital function it serves. </p><p>Sewage is carried from the house to the tank via gravity no motors, no fossil-fuel energy consumption, no noise. Wastewater goes from the tank to the drainfield also via gravity where microorganisms in the soil digest and purify bacteria and viruses. When the soil is suitable and the system healthy, it is an example of efficient design and natural forces, returning clean water to the water table (or to plants or the air) all functioning silently under the surface of the earth </p><p>What Is This Book? </p><p>There are currently more than 25 million septic systems in the United States. Moreover, each year, some 400,000 new systems are built. Yet in spite of such widespread usage, the average homeowner seems to know little about the basic operation and appropriate maintenance of a septic system. </p><p>This book describes the conventional gravity-fed septic system, how it works, how it should be treated (what should and should not go down the drain), how it should be maintained, and what to do if things go wrong. There is also basic information on the recent evolution in composting toilet systems, designs for simple graywater systems, and some of the typical alternatives to the standard, gravity-fed septic system. </p><p>There is a chapter with advice to any community faced with town-wide septic upgrades, and last, an illustrated chapter on the history of waterborne waste disposal. </p><p>As you will see, this is not an engineering treatise. Nor do we cover any of the many non-conventional systems in use in various parts of the country by a variety of wastewater engineers and soil scientists. This is a basic manual for the average homeowner, based on conventional systems, providing practical advice on how to keep these systems up (or should we say down?) and running. </p><p>Who Is This Book For? </p><p>Primarily homeowners (or home dwellers), but also for builders, architects, plumbers, septic contractors, pumpers, and realtors, as well as health departments, wastewater districts, and small towns anyone who wants to understand these very important, but often misunderstood, working principles. </p><p>If you are buying a house with a septic system, it is very important that you understand septic basics, so that you know what you are getting. </p><p>Why the Need for This Book? </p><p>Homeowners will find this book useful in terms of: </p><p>Working systems: By understanding septic system principles, you will know how to treat your system intelligently and maximize its useful life. </p><p>Partially failing systems: By changing daily household practices, and perhaps making minor repairs, you may be able to nurse along an ailing system or even bring it back to life. </p><p>Failing systems: You will be given a discovery process to search for the problem in a given order. You will discover if the problem is relatively easy to fix (as with pipe blockage), or major (drainfield failure). You will understand what went wrong and be given a variety of options for repair. </p><p>Alternative systems: By this we mean alternatives to the gravity-powered system typically, mounds, pressure-dosed drainfields, sand filters, etc. often required by health officials these days. You will be given the basics of these designs so you will understand how they work and what purpose they serve. </p><p>Some Caveats </p><p>The local angle: Although the principles described here are more or less the same all over the world, there are local factors of soil and climate, as well as practical experience, that will differ from region to region. Once you understand the basics, we suggest you talk to local builders, septic tank pumpers, and homeowners. There is no substitute for local experience. The comprehensive angle: We do not cover everything on the subject. We do not describe all possible systems in all parts of the world. Our intent here is to give you the basics, so you can make informed judgments on maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. </p><p>The appropriate technology angle: Unfortunately, regulatory agencies have tended to require higher-tech, more expensive systems in recent years. In some cases, this approach is necessary, but many times its overkill. Granted that there will be situations where soil and/or climate require other options, yet the gravity-fed system remains the simplest and most ecological design; it is the stick shift of septic systems, and therefore, the heart of this book. </p><p>The varying opinions angle: Experts in the field all have different opinions. We have consulted a number of professionals and have attempted to strike a balance as to sensible and useful information for homeowners. </p><p>Ongoing Septic Info </p><p>We will update, supplement, and correct this book in future editions and on the web.

Through writing as passionate as it is relatable, the authors provide an unflinching look at the barriers black Americans face as they try to move out of the place society has designated for them. This book is a searing indictment of our still separate and unequal education system, one that ensures the road to becoming a doctor, or a lawyer or professor, will be much harder for black children than it will be for white. Yet, at its core, Pulse of Perseverance is an inspirational story of what can be accomplished with dedication, the support of people with similar goals, and the investment from institutions dedicated to black success. This book is the North Star for every black child who sees something greater for himself than the world would have him believe.</p><p>Dr. Pierre Johnson, a native of Chicago, is a board certified ob-gyn.

In short, she&#x2019;s a regular mom who wants to encourage other parents to get their regular kids out into nature too. While Susan is an expert hiker in her own right, it&#x2019;s her children who helped her to see hiking from a kid&#x2019;s point of view.

Guidebook features include:<br> <ul> <li>125 hikes&#x2015;carefully selected and vetted by both parents and children</li> <li>Routes range in length from less than 2 miles (great for toddlers) to as much as 6 miles (for older kids who want to test themselves)</li> <li>Handy info blocks give a quick snapshot of each hike: best season, difficulty, length, high point, and elevation gain</li> <li>13 &#x201c;Great Getaways&#x201d;&#x2015;weekend or vacation destinations around the state with hiking trails and other family-fun activities</li> <li>Colorful icons indicate star attractions of the hike: splash zone, wildflowers, old-growth, dog-friendliness, stroller-accessibility, and more</li> <li>&#x201c;Best of&#x201d; lists make it easy for families to match hikes to their kids&#x2019; interests</li> <li>Driving directions, complete trail information, GPS trailhead coordinates, and color map included for each hike</li> <li>Tips on how to motivate kids on the trail, what&#x2019;s appropriate for different ages, nature facts, and more</li></ul> Whether you&#x2019;re looking for the best hikes to hug a really big tree; take a fun and refreshing dip; see birds, animals, or waterfalls; go on a winter day; or stuff yourself with berries, <i>Best Hikes with Kids: Western Washington</i> has you covered.</p><p>Susan Elderkin has been hiking since she was three years old. As a child, she explored the trails of her native Iowa, the Great Lakes, and the Rocky Mountains on day hikes with her parents. This early exposure to the outdoors galvanized a lifelong love of hiking and commitment to the environment. <br><br> In 1995, while backpacking the 500-mile Colorado Trail, Susan had an epiphany: she wanted to give back to hiking trails and she wanted to write a guidebook. Susan moved to Seattle and joined the board of directors of Washington Trails Association and later the staff, where she spent seven years as website editor and communications director. It took much longer -- and some inspiration from her children -- to write the guidebook. <br><br> The book was a family project that took place over 20 months when her kids were between the ages of six and eleven, but the work was informed by hiking with them as babies, toddlers and preschoolers. One or both of her children have accompanied her on more than 80 of the hikes in the books, and her husband, son, and father (as well as some friends) all contributed photographs.</p><h2>Patent, Copyright &amp; Trademark: An Intellectual Property Desk Reference</h2><p><b>A plain-English guide to intellectual property law</b><br><p><br>Whether you are in the world of business or creative arts, you need to understand the laws that govern your work.

Reese makes clear the structural forces that determine food access in urban areas, highlighting Black residents' navigation of and resistance to unequal food distribution systems. Linking these local food issues to the national problem of systemic racism, Reese examines the history of the majority-Black Deanwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork, Reese not only documents racism and residential segregation in the nation's capital but also tracks the ways transnational food corporations have shaped food availability. By connecting community members' stories to the larger issues of racism and gentrification, Reese shows there are hundreds of Deanwoods across the country. <br><br>Reese's geographies of self-reliance offer an alternative to models that depict Black residents as lacking agency, demonstrating how an ethnographically grounded study can locate and amplify nuances in how Black life unfolds within the context of unequal food access.<br><br></p><p>Ashante M. Reese is assistant professor of anthropology at Spelman College.Ashante Reese's work is richly empirical, historically grounded, and speaks to the contemporary national debate about the industrialized food system, access to healthy foods, and connections between food justice, racial uplift, and social change. A much-needed and important work."&#x2014;Kimberly Nettles-Barcelon, University of California, Davis<br><i>Black Food Geographies</i> offers a deep examination of the history and present of Deanwood in Washington, D.C., drawing important connections between the food system of this particular urban locale and what is happening in other important sites of food justice work around the country.

Noll examines writings about slavery and race from Americans both white and black, northern and southern, and includes commentary from Protestants and Catholics in Europe and Canada. Though the Christians on all sides agreed that the Bible was authoritative, their interpretations of slavery in Scripture led to a full-blown theological crisis.<br><br></p><p>"'Crises,' like 'culture wars,' are easily declared but seldom live up to their name. But thanks to Mark Noll's thoroughly researched and brilliantly written <i>The Civil War as a Theological Crisis</i>, we find a subject that was indeed critical--in the generic sense of the term--to the future of Christianity in America. For a long while we have known that the Civil War represented a political and military crisis without peer in American history. Now, really for the first time, we see how the war played out in American theology and biblical interpretation. Using never-before-seen sources from Catholic and Protestant Europe as well as America itself, Noll confirms in stunning detail just how central theological discourse was to the conflagration of North and South. Americans' understanding of the 'baptism in blood' will never be the same after reading this book."--Harry S. Stout, Yale University <br>Prominent theologian Noll considers the Civil War as a major turning point in American religious thought, as both Northerners and Southerners generally agreed on the authority of the Bible but disagreed about what it taught about slavery. He also surveys the observations of foreign Protestants and Catholics, who saw clearly that regardless of how much voluntary reliance on scriptural authority had contributed to the construction of national civilization, if there were no higher religious authority than the personal interpretation of scripture, public deadlock over conflicting interpretations would amount to a full-blown theological crisis.<br></p><h2>Afrikan People and European Holidays: A Mental Genocide, Book 2</h2><p>African-American Studies, Cultural Studies, US and World Politics, African Studies</p><p></p><h2>Chasing Contentment: Trusting God in a Discontented Age</h2><p><p><strong>Recovering the Lost Art of Contentment</strong></p><p>The biblical practice of contentment can seem like a lost art&#x2015;something reserved for spiritual giants but out of reach for the rest of us. In our discontented age&#x2015;characterized by impatience, overspending, grumbling, and unhappiness&#x2015;it&#x2019;s hard to imagine what true contentment actually looks (and feels) like. But even the apostle Paul said that he <em>learned</em> to be content in any and every circumstance. Paul&#x2019;s remarkable contentment was something <em>grown</em> and <em>developed</em> over time.</p><p>In <em>Chasing Contentment</em>, Erik Raymond helps us understand what biblical contentment is&#x2015;the inward gracious spirit that joyfully rests in God&#x2019;s providence&#x2015;and then how we learn it. Giving us practical guidance for growing in contentment in various areas of our lives, this book will encourage us to see contentment as a priority for all believers.

We trust in money, relationships, and circumstances, only to find ourselves increasingly dissatisfied.

I knew of no solid modern book on the matter&#x2015;until now. Erik Raymond&#x2019;s <i>Chasing Contentment</i> is that modern work I have longed to see and use. This book contains the wisdom and insights of the timeless Puritan works, yet brings a culturally relevant pastoral sensitivity that will make this the go-to book on this subject&#x2015;thoroughly biblical, immensely practical.

Drawing from the prophets, the Puritans, and his own personal experience, he puts his finger on our malaise and offers us gospel medicine.

In its opening doxology blessings cascade down upon the reader. In its closing verses the smell of the battlefield lies heavily in the air and through the smoke of war we see Christians, fully clad in the armour of spiritual warfare, still standing. From beginning to end Ephesians sets before us the wonder of God s grace, the privilege of belonging to the church, and the pattern of life-transformation the gospel produces.<br><br>In Let s Study Ephesians Sinclair Ferguson skillfully leads us through this wonderful letter, explaining its teaching with masterful simplicity and showing its importance and relevance to the church today.</p><p>Sinclair B. Ferguson (PhD, University of Aberdeen) is a professor of systematic theology at Westminster Theological Seminary.</p><h2>My Daily Life</h2><p>My Daily Life is the follow-up title, and natural complement to Father Paone&#x2019;s indispensible My Daily Bread. While the latter focused on the interior life, My Daily Life focuses on the exterior life, offering practical advice on daily living and getting to the heart of human nature.<br><br> This powerful little volume will help you navigate a world that is &#x201c;no paradise, neither...an utter hell.&#x201d; My Daily Life offers sound advice on a host of daily struggles, including:<br><br> � How to strive for earthly fulfillment within the bounds of reason, reality, and morality (p. 12)<br> � How to overcome our insecurity in a world that we cannot control (p. 59)<br> � How to achieve self-possession by controlling undue anger (p. 87)<br> � How to face life with a realistic outlook and avoid being overly emotional (p. 122)<br> � How the theological virtue of hope can benefit us in our earthly goals as well (p .273)<br> � And much more...<br><br> Father Paone presents the readings in &#x201c;bite-sized&#x201d; portions that make it easy to maintain a daily devotional schedule. This convenient, palm-sized book is overflowing with common sense, compassion, and holiness. The passages in the book will help transform belief into realization, and theory into practice. My Daily Life is an essential and relatively unknown part of the canon of great Catholic literature.<br><br> My Daily Life is a practical guide that will help you to persevere in the holy resolutions which you make at the time of confession, Holy Communion, missions, retreats, or any moment of grace.<br> A portion of proceeds from every purchase of this Confraternity of the Precious Blood title go directly to The Sisters Adorers of the Precious Blood in Brooklyn, NY to support them in their vocation.<br></p><p>Father Anthony Paone, S.J. was a priest with the Confraternity of the Precious Blood and a beloved teacher at the renowned Brooklyn Preparatory Academy.

This unabridged quality reprint will provide tremendous insight for historians, journalists and anyone deployed in Afghanistan. Contains accounts of numerous actions fought by the Afghan resistance. Each account is told by the Afghan commander who participated in the action described. These commanders in the vast majority, were civilians who took up arms against the Soviets and developed the skills necessary to command guerrilla units. Most of these accounts are supported by a full page map, that show the topography, the locations of the attackers and defenders, movements, fields of fire etc. In addition is an invaluable guide to anyone wishing to understand modern guerrilla warfare, whether conducting one or fighting against guerrillas in the field. In addition this study provides invaluable insights in how to train and support guerrillas in the field. Each operation is commented on to highlight the elements that caused the operation/action to succeed or fail. In the event of failure what should have been done to have prevented such failure, or in the case of success what could have been done to have improved on that success.</p><p>Les Grau is a retired US Army officer who fought guerrillas in South Vietnam and left on a stretcher.

For almost 500 years, the masses have been thoroughly deceived by a cosmic fairy-tale of astronomical proportions. We have been taught a falsehood so gigantic and diabolical that it has blinded us from our own experience and common sense, from seeing the world and the universe as they truly are. Through pseudo-science books and programs, mass media and public education, universities and government propaganda, the world has been systematically brain-washed, slowly indoctrinated over centuries into the unquestioning belief of the greatest lie of all time. A multi-generational conspiracy has succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick up the fixed Earth, shape it into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! The greatest cover-up of all time, Nasa and Freemasonry&#39;s biggest secret, is that we are living on a plane, not a planet, that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe.</p><p></p><h2>The Goon: Bunch of Old Crap Volume 1: An Omnibus</h2><p>The first omnibus volume of Eric Powell's Eisner Award winning series, THE GOON!

An influential work of Christian spirituality &#x201c;The Practice&#x201d; describes Brother Lawrence&#x2019;s philosophy that a relationship with God is more important than the service and work done in God&#x2019;s name. Brother Lawrence focuses on seeing the love of God, his presence, in all aspects of daily life. In this short work an attempt is made to explain Lawrence&#x2019;s method of acquiring this presence of God. According to Brother Lawrence it is only in acquiring this presence that one truly can have a relationship with God. Also included in this work is &#x201c;The Spiritual Maxims&#x201d;, a collection of thoughts intended to give daily inspiration and guidance towards living a more spiritual life. Together these classic works of Christian devotion give great insight into the life and spiritual philosophy of Brother Lawrence.

Weems has been noted and praised for her writing, galvanizing national speaking, and pioneering scholarship in the field of Old Testament studies. Yet in the midst of her celebrated work, she was experiencing a profound spiritual crisis permeated by a hollow, painful silence that seemed, at times, to mark an irreparable rupture in her communication with God. <br> In this deeply affecting book, Weems addresses the believer's yearning for God through periods of inconstancy, vacillation, and disenchantment. Her own spiritual disquietude will be familiar to all who struggle to maintain faith while the details of daily life -- negotiating with children and spouses, caring for ailing parents, living up to professional expectations, developing hobbies, managing finances, and planning for the future -- compete for energy with one's relationship with God. In sharing her own strategies for redefining mundane rituals so that they contribute to reverence and devotion, Weems offers a beacon of light for all believers struggling to listen for God amidst the din of worldly demands and distractions.</p><p>When a preacher has a crisis of faith, the ramifications can be terrifying. How can you lead a congregation to God, when God has withdrawn His presence from you? A few years ago, Renita J. Weems, one of the nation's leading black women preachers, hit a spiritual brick wall that she describes in her stark, lyrical, and often amazing memoir, <i>Listening for God: A Believer's Journey Through Silence and Doubt</i>. The book is a collection of prayers, journal entries, and meditations that discuss her initial anger at God's absence in her life and her gradual willingness to "[accept] the silence as a new way of communicating with the divine and [learn] to perceive God in my life in new, amusing, laughable, glorious ways." In contrast to the many spiritual memoirs that relate new believers' intoxicating experience of divine intimacy, <i>Listening for God</i> (like C.S. Lewis's <i>A Grief Observed</i> and Madeleine L'Engle's <i>The Irrational Season</i>) stands out as a careful and honest description of the spiritual desert in which many mature believers find themselves stranded, to their dismay and surprise. This book is further distinguished by Weems's frank observation that, as a wife and mother, she couldn't just up and meditate for an hour a day, or go on extended retreat. "If God was going to speak to me," Weems writes, "God would just have to do it amidst the clutter of family, the noise of pots and pans, the din of a hungry toddler screaming from the backseat during rush hour traffic, and the hassles of the workplace." God did, and Weems captures the divine noise with a near-perfect combination of wit, pleasure, and respect. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Renita J.

What emerged was a story wrought with sex, manipulation, and deceit that stunned the public at every turn. Arias, always playing the wronged and innocent woman, changed her story continually as her bizarre behavior surrounding the crime and its aftermath came to light. Unwavering, Arias and her defense team continued to play off the salacious details of the case, until she was finally found guilty and&#x2014;controversially&#x2014;sentenced to life behind bars.</p><p>Now, speaking openly for the first time, prosecutor Juan Martinez will unearth new details from the investigation that were never revealed at trial, exploring key facts from the case and the pieces of evidence he chose to keep close to the vest. Throughout the trials, his bullish and unfaltering prosecution strategy was both commended and criticized, and in his book, Martinez will illuminate the unique tactics he utilized in this case and how they lead to a successful conviction, and-for the first time-discuss how he felt losing the death penalty sentence he&#x2019;d pursued for years.</p><p>Going beyond the news reports, Martinez will explore the truth behind the multiple facades of Jodi Arias. Sparring with her from across the stand, Martinez came to know Arias like no one else could, dissecting what it took for a seemingly normal girl to become a deluded, cunning, and unrepentant murderer.</p><p>With new stories from behind the scenes of the trial and Martinez&#x2019;s own take on his defendant, the book takes you inside the mind of Jodi Arias like never before. Complete with 16 pages of photos from the case and trial, this book is the definitive account of the case that shocked America.</p></p><p><p>When the nude photo of a teenage runaway shows up on a website, the girl&#x2019;s father turns to Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks for help. But these aren&#x2019;t unusual circumstances, for the runaway is the daughter of a man who&#x2019;s determined to destroy the dedicated Yorkshire policeman&#x2019;s career and good name.</p><p>Still, it&#x2019;s a case that Banks&#x2014;a father himself&#x2014;dares not ignore as he follows its trail into teeming London. But when a series of gruesome murders follows soon after, Banks finds himself pulled into the past and private world of his most powerful enemy, Chief Constable Jimmy Riddle.</p>Peter Robinson is at the height of his storytelling skills in this twisting novel of suspense that proves you can never escape their pasts&#x2014;especially when there are sordid secrets waiting to be revealed.<p>Juan Martinez began working for the Maricopa County Attorney&#x2019;s office in 1988. In his twenty-seven-year career with the office, he has spent nineteen years prosecuting homicide cases. Some of his most noteworthy cases include Arizona v. Wendi Andriano, who was convicted of first-degree murder and was the first woman sentenced to death by a jury in Arizona; Arizona v. Scott Falater, which was noted for the use of sleepwalking as a defense to the murder of his wife; Arizona v. Loren Wade, in which an Arizona State University football player was convicted of the shooting murder of an ex-ASU football player; and Arizona v. Rick Wayne Valentini, which resulted in a conviction for murder even though the victim&#x2019;s body was never found.</p></p><h2>Bites on a Board</h2><p><p><i>Delicious recipes and creative presentations served up on a board.</i></p> <p>Cutting boards aren&#x2019;t just for prep anymore.

Characterized by numerous small cysts in the ovaries, PCOS affects up to 10 percent of all women and 14 million women in the United States alone. It is linked to infertility, diabetes, heart disease, and endometrial cancer. While this disorder is believed to be genetic and incurable, it is controllable.</p><p>In this prescriptive plan, dietitian Hillary Wright demystifies the condition by explaining its underlying cause--insulin resistance--and helps readers understand how diet and lifestyle can influence reproductive hormones and decrease risk for diabetes, heart disease, and infertility. This book is packed with simple dietary and nutritional specifics: day-to-day strategies, sample meal&nbsp;plans, and shopping and snack lists. Updates include new information on diet therapy and exercise, the newest research on PCOS and soy and dairy, revised meal plans, and updated resources and shopping lists. <i>The PCOS Diet Plan </i>is the most comprehensive and authoritative guide to managing this increasingly diagnosed condition.</p></p><p>HILLARY WRIGHT is the director of nutritional counseling at the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF, a Harvard-affiliated fertility treatment center. She is a registered and licensed dietitian with more than twenty years experience counseling clients on diet and lifestyle change. Wright serves part-time as a nutritionist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She is also a former&nbsp;contributing editor and regular writer for the newsletter <i>Environmental Nutrition.<br></i><b>Introduction&nbsp;</b><br><br>The first time a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) showed up in my office, I had no idea what to do for her. In addition to enduring many troubling symptoms of the condition, she was also struggling with infertility. It was early 2000, and I had just returned to work from maternity leave after having my third son. I&#x2019;d had no problems conceiving my first child, but it had taken almost a year and a half to get pregnant with my second son after treatment for secondary infertility three years earlier. As a fertility patient myself, I understood what she was going through. I&#x2019;d been through all the tests&#x2014;hormone tests, an endometrial biopsy, a hysterosalpingogram (a procedure that involves blasting dye through the fallopian tubes to make sure they&#x2019;re open, which in some cases actually paves the way for conception even if no blockages are found), and serial HCG (pregnancy hormone) tests once I got a positive pregnancy test. The barrage of tests left my arms looking like those of an IV drug addict. Fortunately, the solution to my secondary infertility had been some relatively simple hormonal tweaking, and, interestingly, I hadn&#x2019;t required any intervention for my third child. But I was well aware how complicated the quest to have a child could get. This woman&#x2019;s course was likely to be much more complicated than mine: she was overweight, her hormones were out of whack, and her stress level was through the roof. Her treatment would involve more than a few well-timed hormone shots.&nbsp;<br><br>Given my personal experience with fertility challenges, I was thrilled that Dr. Natalie Schultz was interested in developing a partnership between the fertility and nutrition departments at the large medical practice in Boston where I worked as a nutritionist and she as a fertility specialist. I&#x2019;d received my medical care from Natalie, and we had become close during my treatment. Besides being a fantastic physician, she was a big fan of the nutritionists in the practice, so when she also started to see women with PCOS, she looked to us for help.&nbsp;<br><br>Back then, I had no idea what this strange-sounding condition was, never mind how diet and lifestyle could potentially affect it. But Natalie was confident that we&#x2019;d make a great team and could ultimately make a difference in these women&#x2019;s lives. She patiently explained PCOS to me and answered my questions, as I tried to piece together some sort of diet therapy. I had my own team of nutritionists for collaboration. First was my biochemistry-whiz nutritionist colleague Ann Stawaris, who loves nothing more than debating the virtues of enzymes and chemical pathways. Next I found New York dietitian Martha McKittrick, who willingly shared with me what she knew about the condition. I also consulted what I consider the bible on PCOS, Samuel Thatcher&#x2019;s <i>PCOS: The Hidden Epidemic.</i>1&nbsp;<br><br>The key to figuring out how to manage PCOS nutritionally was learning that in most cases, the driving force behind the condition is insulin resistance, something I knew a lot about. Growing up, two of my five siblings had type 1 diabetes, which is caused by a lack of the pancreatic hormone insulin. Insulin resistance, a condition characterized by inefficient use of this hormone, is the cause of the more common form of diabetes in the United States, known as type 2 diabetes. This early exposure to the world of diabetes care got me interested in becoming a dietitian in the first place.&nbsp;<br><br>Using my knowledge of how to manage insulin resistance, I began to treat women with PCOS. Initially there were just a few patients, but over time the number has grown to hundreds. One thing became clear: the women with PCOS had many symptoms and complaints in common, and most of them felt fairly underserved by the medical profession. I realized that many nutritionists knew little about this condition, and a number of them began to look to me for guidance. I developed a presentation on managing PCOS for dietitians in my area; time and again, I would receive the same feedback: &#x201c;I really know nothing about this&#x201d; and &#x201c;Oh my God, I think I have it!&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t surprising, given that more than 97 percent of registered dietitians are female!&nbsp;<br><br> As we began to see more women with PCOS in our medical practice, the nutritionists and the fertility and endocrinology department began running group support classes for women with PCOS, many of whom were thrilled to have a place to finally talk about their health. A common thread for many of these women was knowing for <i>years </i>that something was wrong but never being able to get much satisfaction&#x2014;or symptom relief&#x2014;from their physicians. PCOS is a hormonal problem, and women&nbsp;would describe a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms. Many intuitively felt that their symptoms were connected, but unfortunately they frequently reported being brushed off by their doctors.&nbsp;<br><br> In the medical establishment&#x2019;s defense, at the time there just was not as much awareness of the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome. For these women to finally land in the hands of a health-care team that got it was an amazingly affirming experience. As positive as this sense of validation can be, however, it is unnerving to learn about the reality of what a diagnosis of PCOS can mean to a woman&#x2019;s overall health and fertility. Many women felt overwhelmed by the diet and lifestyle changes necessary to reduce the risks of a number of scary health problems, including diabetes and heart disease. In my experience, many women were first diagnosed with PCOS after seeking medical advice to find out why they weren&#x2019;t getting pregnant. It&#x2019;s easy to understand why they&#x2019;d feel overwhelmed and stressed.&nbsp;<br><br> The PCOS support group we established was incredibly diverse: we had young women, older women (who were just figuring out the diagnosis despite years of fertility treatments!), straight women, gay women, teenage girls and their moms, women trying to get pregnant, and women with no interest in kids but a strong interest in avoiding diabetes.&nbsp;<br><br> I continued to see a steady stream of PCOS patients until I left the practice in 2006 to take a part-time job at Boston&#x2019;s Dana Farber Cancer Institute. At this point I also established a private nutrition counseling practice that would ultimately be absorbed by the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF, one of the nation&#x2019;s oldest and most successful fertility treatment practices in the country. I was recruited by Dr. Alice Domar, an international expert on the application of mind-body medicine to women&#x2019;s health issues, specifically for my expertise in the nutrition management of PCOS. I&#x2019;ve been blessed to work alongside some amazing therapists, acupuncturists, clinicians, and support staff&#x2014;all of whom are vested in the Domar Center&#x2019;s philosophy of providing comprehensive care that is &#x201c;grounded in science, inspired by compassion.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>That motto nicely frames my intentions for this book, <i>The PCOS Diet Plan</i>: to provide diet and lifestyle information that is backed by science and designed to empower women diagnosed with this condition. When applied soundly to one&#x2019;s own life, this information can initiate broad health and life-enhancing effects. The strategies described in this book&nbsp;are not overrestrictive or off the wall, and they can easily be followed by anyone interested in healthy living. They require a little education on how female bodies work&#x2014;or, more specifically, how women&#x2019;s bodies were <i>designed </i>to work&#x2014;and how we can adjust diet and lifestyle to work <i>with </i>our genetic makeup in an environment that often colludes against it.</p><h2>So Far from the Bamboo Grove</h2><p><p>In the final days of World War II, Koreans were determined to take back control of their country from the Japanese and end the suffering caused by the Japanese occupation.

Amidst such chaos and confusion, we long to hear God's voice with greater clarity. <br><br> God wants to put things in order. He wants to rearrange our priorities. If we let him, we will be happier than we ever thought possible in this lifetime, and finally then we will come to know the peace for which we all yearn, but so few of us ever find. Our Catholic spirituality is constantly inviting us to establish the deep roots of order in our lives, and one of the best ways I know to do that is by praying the Rosary. <br><br> The Rosary works. It's a very powerful way to pray. There is just something about it that settles our hearts and minds. It puts everything in perspective and allows us to see things as they really are. It reaches deep down into our souls and puts us at ease, creating a peace that is rare and beautiful. <br><br> When I pray the Rosary, I am a better person. It makes me a better son, brother, husband, father, employer, neighbor, citizen, and member of the human family. It teaches me to slow down, calm down, let go, surrender, and listen. The Rosary teaches me how to simply be, and that is not a small or insignificant lesson. It is the perfect prayer for busy people in a busy, noisy, confused world. <br><br> But don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself. Develop a habit of praying the Rosary, and discover the treasures of this powerful, ancient prayer.</p><p>Matthew Kelly was born in Sydney, Australia.

Her books include the Scaredy Squirrel, Chester and Learning With Animals series, Augustine, Leon the Chameleon and Have I Got a Book for You! She lives near Montreal.</p>Gr. 1-3. In a tongue-in-cheek tale that may help to prod anxious readers out of their hidebound routines, a squirrel discovers the pleasures of leaping into the unknown. As the world's a scary place, what with the killer bees, green Martians, tarantulas, germs, and sharks that might be lurking about, Scaredy Squirrel keeps to his tree, and to a precise, minute-by-minute daily schedule--until a supposed "killer bee" actually wanders by, causing Squirrel to dislodge his suitcase-size emergency kit. A wild lunge to rescue it turns into a long glide (portrayed in a gatefold), as Squirrel discovers to his astonishment that he is a flying squirrel. Eventually, Squirrel returns in triumph to his tree and from then on adds a daily glide to his accustomed rounds. Despite the simply drawn cartoons and brief text, this is more sophisticated in tone than Martin Waddell's <i>Tiny's Big Adventure</i> (2004), though the message is similar. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When polio kept her bedridden for nine months, drawing saved her from boredom. When a bus accident left her in unimaginable agony, her paintings expressed her pain and depression - and eventually, her joys and her loves. Over and over again, Frida Kahlo turned the challenges of her life into art. Now Jonah Winter and Ana Juan have drawn on both the art and the life to create a playful, insightful tribute to one of the twentieth century&#39;s most influential artists. Viva Frida!</p><p>Beset by one shattering ordeal after another, world-renowned painter Frida Kahlo always managed to channel her anguish into creativity. <i>Frida</i>, by Jonah Winter and illustrator Ana Juan, is an exquisite and playful glimpse into the artist's life and work. Filled with the folk art icons of Frida's Mexican culture--monkeys, devils, smiling skeletons, and sympathetic jaguars depicted with acrylics and wax on paper--the book describes, in short streams of text, the feisty, irreverent, fierce nature of the artist. One especially memorable illustration, based on one of Frida Kahlo's own paintings, shows Frida herself caught in a tangle of thorns against a mournful blue night sky. The text reads, "After the accident ... her body will hurt, always." Author and illustrator's notes add background information, but this stunning book from the author of <i>Diego</i>, about famed Mexican muralist (and husband of Frida) Diego Rivera, is a spectacular, lush introduction to an inspiring woman and her art.

Ollie has a life-threatening allergy to electricity, and Moritz's weak heart requires a pacemaker. If they ever did meet, they could both die. Living as recluses from society, the boys develop a fierce bond through letters that become a lifeline during dark times--as Ollie loses his only friend, Liz, to the normalcy of high school and Moritz deals with a bully set on destroying him. But when Moritz reveals the key to their shared, sinister past that began years ago in a mysterious German laboratory, their friendship faces a test neither one of them expected. </p><p>Narrated in letter form by Ollie and Moritz--two extraordinary new voices--this story of impossible friendship and hope under strange circumstances blends elements of science fiction with coming of age themes, in a humorous, dark, and ultimately inspiring tale that is completely unforgettable.</p><p>A William C.

Morris YA Debut Award finalist, <i>Because You'll Never Meet Me</i>.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Ollie and Moritz are at the center of a unique and oddly compelling friendship in this epistolary debut. Ollie has a form of epilepsy that renders him "allergic to electricity," while Moritz, born without eyes, has a pacemaker to help control his cardiomyopathy. Both boys live in reclusive isolation, but when they begin to exchange letters, they find an unexpected opportunity to share their hopes, challenges, sorrows, and the tragic secrets that unite them. Ollie and Moritz are memorable characters with engaging and often humorous voices, and the dual narration creates tension as they reveal more of their lives to one another&#x2014;including their struggles with loneliness, self-acceptance, brutal tormentors, first love, and the weight of the past. The story flirts with several genres before settling into science fiction by its close. Coupled with the questionable reliability of its narrators, this lends it a quirky, almost whimsical feel even as Thomas grounds it in heartfelt and often painful emotion. VERDICT Despite shades of melodrama and a few plot contrivances, this will intrigue readers with its unusual premise.&#x2014;Lauren Strohecker, McKinley Elementary School, Abington School District, PA</p><h2>The Remarkable Women of the Bible Growth and Study Guide: And Their Message for Your Life Today (Growth and Study Guides)</h2><p><p>This practical study guide is a wonderful complement to <i>The Remarkable Women of the Bible </i>by Elizabeth George as well as a powerful exploration of lives changed by God's love.

In the telling, bizarre ancestors appear before our eyes; we hear both delightful and bitter childhood memories, amazing anecdotes of youthful years, and the most intimate secrets passed along in whispers. With Paula, Allende has written a powerful autobiography whose straightforward acceptance of the magical and spiritual worlds will remind readers of her first book, <em>The House of the Spirits.</em></p> <p><strong>Please note, front cover image of the item may vary.<br></strong></p></p><p>"Listen, Paula. I am going to tell you a story so that when you wake up you will not feel so lost." So says Chilean writer Isabel Allende (<i>The House of the Spirits</i>) in the opening lines of the luminous, heart-rending memoir she wrote while her 28-year-old daughter Paula lay in a coma. In its pages, she ushers an assortment of outrageous relatives into the light: her stepfather, an amiable liar and tireless debater; grandmother Meme, blessed with second sight; and delinquent uncles who exultantly torment Allende and her brothers. Irony and marvelous flights of fantasy mix with the icy reality of Paula's deathly illness as Allende sketches childhood scenes in Chile and Lebanon; her uncle Salvatore Allende's reign and ruin as Chilean president; her struggles to shake off or find love; and her metamorphosis into a writer.One of the most popular and acclaimed Latin American authors of our century presents this unforgettable memoir, an exquisitely rendered, deeply moving mother-daughter story that doubles as her autobiography. <p><i>Paula </i>is a soul-baring memoir one reads without drawing a breath, like a novel of suspense. The point of departure for these moving pages is a tragic personal experience. In December 1991, Isabel Allende's daughter, Paula, became gravely ill and shortly thereafter fell into a coma. During hours in the hospital, the author began to write the story of her family for her unconscious daughter. In the telling, bizarre ancestors appear before our eyes, and we hear both delightful and bitter childhood memories, amazing anecdotes of youthful years, the most intimate secrets passed along in whispers. Chile, Allende's native land, comes alive as well, with the turbulent history of the military coup of 1973, the following dictatorship and her family's years of exile. </p><p>As an exorcism of death, in these pages Isabel Allende explores the past and questions the gods. The result is a magical book that carries the reader from tears to laughter, from terror to sensuality and wisdom. <i>Paula</i> is a prodigious evocation and a hymn to life, written from the heart of the courageous and estimable woman who created <i>The House of the Spirits</i>.</p></p><h2>Hiding in the Light: Why I Risked Everything to Leave Islam and Follow Jesus</h2><p><b>Leaving Islam for Christianity cost her more than she imagined, but gave more than she could have dreamed.<br><br></b>Rifqa Bary grew up in a devout Muslim home, obediently following her parents&#x2019; orders to practice the rituals of Islam. But God was calling her to freedom and love. He was calling her to true faith. He was calling her to give up everything.<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Hiding in the Light </i>is the story of Rifqa&#x2019;s remarkable spiritual journey from Islam to Christianity. It is also the untold story of how she ran from her father&#x2019;s threats to find refuge with strangers in Florida, only to face a controversial court case that reached national headlines. Most of all, it is the story of a young girl who made life-changing sacrifices to follow Jesus&#x2014;and who inspires us to do the same.</p><p><b>Fatima Rifqa Bary</b>, a native of Sri Lanka, moved with her family to the United States at the age of eight. She secretly converted from Islam to Christianity at age twelve. When her family discovered her secret four years later, she ran away from home&#x2014;and her story made national headlines. Still living in an undisclosed location, Rifqa&#x2019;s passions are prayer, missions, and people. She also cherishes long talks with loved ones over coffee and eating lots of chicken curry.&#x201c;Rifqa Bary&#x2019;s story is a powerful testimony to standing for the truth in the face of many difficulties and tall odds. In the words of this young woman who has already been through so much, we are painted a picture of stark cultural contrast&#x2014;that of slavery and liberty, duty and love, and bondage and freedom. As much as anything, this is a story about the first freedom upon which America was built&#x2014;the freedom to believe and live one&#x2019;s life according to those beliefs.

Her heartbreaking journey is hard to fathom, and yet her suffering was the one thing that led her to Jesus. This story will give you not only insight into what it means for a Muslim to convert to Christianity and the heavy price associated with that, but also the importance of Christians breaking through the stereotypes and reaching out to Muslims in love.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Naghmeh Abedini, wife of imprisoned pastor Saeed Abedini<br><br> &#x201c;Not only does Rifqa Bary&#x2019;s story bring to light key tenets of Islam we so need to understand, it will show you the courage true faith provides.

In my own experience as a child, I had hidden in a cocoon of despair and lived with the brutality of loneliness&#x2014;I understand how she felt.

Most churches are small, and rightly so. With power being redistributed in our time, networks of smaller enterprises are both growing and thriving. The yearning for participation and empowerment has us all looking for versions of church that make room for everyone. Perhaps, after all our hand wringing and insecurity about the size of our churches, we have missed the point. Microchurches can be strong, beautiful, accessible and potent portraits of just what Jesus had in mind, if not for all time, at least for ours. This book is a guide to understanding, appreciating and if you are up for it, starting a micro church.</p><p></p><h2>Advanced Statistics in Research: Reading, Understanding, and Writing Up Data Analysis Results</h2><p><em><i>Advanced Statistics in Research: Reading, Understanding, and Writing Up Data Analysis Results</i> is the simple, nontechnical introduction to the most complex multivariate statistics presented in empirical research articles.</em> <p> </p> <i>wwwStatsInResearch.com,</i> is a companion website that provides free sample chapters, exercises, and PowerPoint slides for students and teachers.

Political ideologies are not merely a matter of governmental efficacy, but are intrinsically and inescapably religious: each carries certain assumptions about the nature of reality, individuals and society, as well as a particular vision for the common good. These fundamental beliefs transcend the political sphere, and the astute Christian observer can discern the ways&#x2015;sometimes subtle, sometimes not&#x2015;in which ideologies are rooted in idolatrous worldviews. In this freshly updated, comprehensive study, political scientist David Koyzis surveys the key political ideologies of our era, including liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, democracy, and socialism. Koyzis gives each philosophy careful analysis and fair critique, unpacking the worldview issues inherent to each and pointing out essential strengths and weaknesses, as well as revealing the "narrative structure" of each&#x2015;the stories they tell to make sense of public life and the direction of history. Koyzis concludes by proposing alternative models that flow out of Christianity's historic engagement with the public square, retrieving approaches for both individuals and the global, institutional church that hold promise for the complex political realities of the twenty-first century. Writing with broad international perspective and keen analytical insight, Koyzis is a sane and sensible guide for Christians working in the public square, culture watchers, political pundits, and all students of modern political thought.</p><p>David T. Koyzis holds the PhD in government and international studies from the University of Notre Dame. He taught undergraduate political science for thirty years."This second edition of David's great book is a gem. The brighter light he now shines on his assessment of modern ideologies comes from an in-depth assessment of the <em>story</em> each tells and the <em>idolatry</em> exhibited in each one. This also pushes Christians to examine the extent to which we may be compromising our dedication to God by bowing (even unconsciously) to other gods for political guidance. In this day of heightening nationalism, racism, terrorism, and sheer ignorance, the message of this book could not be more urgent or important. Read and discuss it carefully even if it takes weeks to do so. The multiple forces at work in our homelands and around the world will not be thwarted or redirected by one election or one major event. Christian love of God and neighbor demands responsible civic service and that requires the kind of understanding provided by <em> Political Visions and Illusions</em>." (James W. Skillen, president (now retired) of the Center for Public Justice)<br><br>"Politics involves the acquisition and use of power. It always has a moral dimension, always offers a chance to do good, and always carries the risk of idolatry. Updating his original work in this second edition, Koyzis has written a superb overview of modern politics, ideologies and the state, and their intersection with Christian faith. Rich in scholarship, perceptive and engaging in its analysis, and 'merely Christian' in its importance for all followers of Jesus Christ regardless of their tradition, it's an indispensable resource." (Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of Philadelphia)<br><br>"David Koyzis introduces readers to the range of political theories that have emerged and competed for dominance since classical times. He carefully and respectfully separates wheat from chaff in each of them in terms of a Christian worldview, and in a style that is clear, irenic, and persuasive. The second edition helpfully updates the first in terms of major political events of the past two decades. In an increasingly polarized world, this kind of book is essential reading for concerned citizens of all political and religious leanings." (Mary S. Van Leeuwen, professor emerita of psychology and philosophy, Eastern University)<br><br>"<em>Political Visions and Illusions</em> is an absolutely indispensable text written by the most significant evangelical political theorist of our day. In it, Koyzis skillfully unmasks the idolatry in modern political ideologies before offering a compelling nonideological vision for politics and public life. Its relevance extends beyond political science to the disciplines of public theology, ethics, and philosophy&#x2015;highly recommended." (Bruce Riley Ashford, provost/dean of the faculty, professor of theology and culture, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Few could have anticipated the major political upheavals witnessed since this book first came out in 2003. Yet Koyzis's book has stood the test of time, ranking, in my opinion, as the best introduction to modern political thought from a Christian perspective. This updated edition is welcome in its inclusion both of newer literature and fresh examples to recent political developments. As a politically engaged theologian, I'm especially thrilled to see the addition of the 'Concluding Ecclesiological Postscript' that could very well serve as kind of theo-political compass for church leaders wanting navigational guidance on how churches should&#x2015;and should not&#x2015;engage in political action." (David Guretzki, executive vice president and resident theologian, The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada)<br><br>"Koyzis offers an accessible, compelling, and deeply researched introduction to the major political ideologies at work in the world today. Throughout the book Koyzis serves the reader as a faithful and thoughtful Christian guide through the many competing political voices active in the public square. I've been assigning <em>Political Visions and Illusions</em> in my courses on faith and politics for years now, and I'm so grateful for a new and updated edition. It is a true gift." (Matthew Kaemingk, assistant professor of Christian ethics, associate dean, Fuller Theological Seminary, Texas)<br><br>"The first edition of this excellent book showed in lively and erudite prose how biblical insights into idolatry illuminate our political life. This expanded edition increases its scope and delineates the newer challenges we face. It is indispensable reading." (Paul Marshall, Jerry and Susie Wilson Professor of Religious Freedom, Baylor University)<br><br>"Although the first edition of <em>Political Visions and Illusions</em> has already been praised in Brazil as an invaluable tool of Christian political formation, from young students and clergy to federal prosecutors and career politicians, the new edition confirms itself as a classic. The author deepens the conversation of ideology and idolatry, recovering the central role of narrative for ideology. He greatly enhances his explanation and extracts the equivalents of the biblical creation/fall/redemption/consummation narrative ingrained within the core stories of liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, democratism, and socialism. Dr. Koyzis also updates his approach by engaging novel critiques of those ideologies, such as Patrick Deneen&#x2019;s on liberalism; listening to relevant Christian political thinkers, such as David L. Schindler; and introducing new insights of his own, such as his theory of authority.

Talk to William Joyce and look at upcoming work at @HeyBillJoyce on Twitter and Instagram.Ollie&#x2019;s Odyssey 1<p></p> Lost and Found<p></p> <br>When Billy was born he was nearly lost. He came into this world with a small hole in his heart, and for the first few days of his life, he was seldom with his mother and father. He was shuffled from room to room through the maze of hallways that made up the hospital where he was born. The doctors did many tests on Billy, mostly to see how large this hole was and if, as one doctor said, &#x201c;It was something to be really worried about.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Billy&#x2019;s mother and father were told about this hole, they were much more than worried. They were afraid in a way they had not felt since they were small children, since before they had learned the words to describe their feelings. But there were no words that could describe or give comfort to the deep unease and desperation they now felt. A new baby is suddenly the dearest thing alive to a mother and father. In one miraculous moment a bond forms that is stronger than any other in life.<br> <br>Billy has a hole in his heart. Will he be all right? He must be. This was all they would allow themselves to think.<br> <br>So as they sat at the hospital, waiting, waiting, waiting to hear any news, Billy&#x2019;s parents were in a quiet, fearful agony of not knowing. When kids are afraid they hide under the covers, or cry, or scream, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared!&#x201d; But grown-ups sit very still and try to act like everything is okay&#x2014;even if they feel like hiding or crying or screaming, they usually will not. This is a grown-up thing called &#x201c;coping,&#x201d; which is just a polite way of saying they are terrified.<br> <br>Billy&#x2019;s father coped by holding his hands together very tightly and clenching his jaw until it ached. And his mother coped by making a small stuffed toy for Billy. &#x201c;Toy&#x201d; is a word that feels pleasant in thoughts and memories. But &#x201c;toy&#x201d; is also a limited word. Under the right circumstances a toy can become so very much more than something to be played with or amused by.<br> <br>It can become miraculous.<br> <br>This toy that Billy&#x2019;s mother was sewing was already special. It was made of various kinds of deliciously comfortable fabric, which she had chosen with great care. And its shape was very pleasing. It looked like a teddy bear, but for reasons that Billy&#x2019;s mother could not explain, she had also given it long ears that were vaguely rabbit-like. So it wasn&#x2019;t really a bear or a rabbit; it was something all its own. It wore a blue-striped hoodie and a red scarf around its neck and had a simple, hopeful face that gave the impression of friendliness.<br> <br><br> <br>Billy&#x2019;s mother had a keen eye and a mother&#x2019;s instinct to guide her as she made this funny little rabbit toy. Her sewing was expert. This toy may have been homemade, but it didn&#x2019;t look odd or shabby&#x2014;it looked steadfast and unusually charming. This is a toy that will matter, she told herself.<br> <br>As she sat in the hospital waiting room, trying not to be scared for baby Billy, she was adding a last bit to the toy that would set it apart from any other in the world. She gently sewed into its chest a small heart. The heart was made from a scrap of fabric that came from something very dear to her&#x2014;a toy she had loved as a child. The toy that had been her favorite.<br> <br>She had called that toy Nina. It was a lovely doll, and the first time she&#x2019;d ever held it, the name popped into her head and somehow seemed perfect.<br> <br><br> <br>Nina had been with her constantly through her childhood, and even when the doll had been loved till it had fallen to shreds, Billy&#x2019;s mom had kept a bit of its once-lovely dress and the tiny bell that had been inside of Nina.<br> <br>So now these tokens of her own childhood would live on in this toy for her Billy. The bell was inside the heart, and though the blue cotton fabric was packed snugly around it, it gave a faint but pleasant jingle every time the toy was moved.<br> <br>When Billy&#x2019;s mom made the last stitch, she closed her eyes for a moment as a thousand memories of Nina flooded back to her. But this remembrance was interrupted. She realized the doctor was standing there. He was holding Billy, who was wrapped in blankets and not moving.<br> <br>For a moment the parents&#x2019; hearts stopped. But the doctor was smiling at them, and they heard Billy make a yawning sound.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very small hole,&#x201d; the doctor explained. &#x201c;A few years ago we wouldn&#x2019;t even have been able to detect it. It should close up on its own. And Billy will never even know he had it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Billy was okay.<br> <br>Billy&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; fear faded away, and before they knew it they were holding him. Billy was tightly clutching one of the toy&#x2019;s ears in his surprisingly strong baby grip. He made a funny little sound: OLLY OLLY OLLY. And in that instant Billy&#x2019;s parents knew the toy&#x2019;s name: Oliver, Ollie for short.<br> <br>What they never realized was that another small bit of magic had occurred.<br> <br>Ollie knew his name too.</p><h2>Theme Park Design &amp; The Art of Themed Entertainment</h2><p><p><strong>Want to design a theme park?</strong></p> <p>Over the past century, theme parks have created worlds where pirates still loot Caribbean towns, where daring adventurers explore booby-trapped temples, and where superheroes swing from New York skyscrapers - and allowed us to step into them too.&nbsp;<strong>This is a book about how to design those fantastic places, and the ingenuity that goes into their creation.</strong></p> <p>This is a handbook for the practicing designer, a textbook for the aspiring student, and a behind the scenes guidebook for the theme park fan, building on hundreds of interviews with accomplished designers from Walt Disney Imagineering, Universal Creative, Merlin Entertainments, and more.&nbsp;<em>Theme Park Design &amp; The Art of Themed Entertainment&nbsp;</em>explores everything from the stories, themes, and characters that theme parks bring to life, to the business models, processes, and techniques that allow them to do it.</p> <p>From rocket ships to roller coasters, fairy tales to fireworks, and dinosaurs to dark rides, never before has a book dived so deep into the art form of themed entertainment.</p></p><p><p>"This is the most thorough book on theme park design I have ever seen. One that quotes real designers with priceless knowledge." - Peter Alexander, Lead Designer of Universal Studios Florida <br> <br> "I can't imagine a person contemplating a role in themed entertainment not coming out of this immersive experience inside David Younger's mind without the equivalent of a Master's Degree in the psychology of the themed experience." - Tony Baxter, Lead Designer of Disneyland Paris<br> <br> "An invaluable reference for both the practicing designer and for anyone who wants to learn this art form." - Anthony Esparza, Chief Creative Officer of SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment <br> <br> "A comprehensive textbook that codifies theme park design in a way that no single book has achieved before it." - Craig Hanna, Chief Creative Officer at The Thinkwell Group <br> <br> "David Younger has distilled the theme park design and production process from a vast cloud of pixie dust into a thoroughly-researched and incredibly detailed account of how dreams are made. It's the perfect balance of pull-back-the-curtain magic and intelligent discussion of theme parks from concept to completion." - Garner Holt, Chief Executive Officer at Garner Holt Productions <br> <br> "David Younger has created one of the finest studies of the themed entertainment industry ever attempted. It is a comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of every aspect of this most complex design discipline from the micro to the macro levels without once becoming heavy handed." - Steve Kirk, Lead Designer of Tokyo DisneySea <br> <br> "Probably the most comprehensive summation of themed design committed to print. David Younger has really pulled it all together, in one very readable package." - Joe Lanzisero, Lead Designer of the Disney Dream Cruise Ship (2010) <br> <br> "Theme Park Design is an amazing compendium of theme park and themed entertainment knowledge. This book covers the who, what, where, and why of creating themed entertainment projects and includes personal insights from the top thought leaders and designers who have shaped the theme park industry over the last sixty years. This is a must read for anyone interested in this highly creative and technical industry." - Monte Lunde, Founder of the Themed Entertainment Association <br> <br> "The art of theme park design involves more alchemy than it does art or science, and much of the secret sauce resides behind the obvious surface. Perhaps that's why so little has been written about the subject, let alone anything of practical value. David Younger's book is the first to break down many of these illusive and temporal theories into distinct, understandable, and enlightening observations." - Tom Morris, Lead Designer of Hong Kong Disneyland <br> <br> "Expertise is real, and, at least in part, quantifiable, as David Younger's magnum opus demonstrates. By amassing the communal knowledge of this disparate and diverse group into a single opus, David Younger has provided us all with a landmark in our intellectual space." - Joe Rohde, Lead Designer of Disney's Animal Kingdom <br> <br> "In this insightful book, David Younger burrows into the theme park industry in an intelligent and thorough way, analyzing it from the perspective many of us take for granted and never bother to articulate. This book will become the definitive work to guide theme park designers." - John Wardley, Lead Designer of Alton Towers<br> </p></p><h2>Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Samson Raphael Hirsch (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>This dictionary, based on the commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, is a monumental work and guide to understanding the Biblical commentary of Rabbi Hirsch.

This book also reveals the biblical solution that will lead to the complete liberation of a people.

This one won't end for a very long time!&nbsp;<br><br></p><p><strong>Review:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The word glimmer can be defined as a flicker, a flash, or even a twinkle. I like the glow of a twinkle! At first it was difficult for me to understand what a &#x201c;glimmer of change&#x201d; can be? After finishing the book I then understood its more about the &#x201c;how&#x201d; changes take place. "Change&#x201d; can quickly and dynamically alter one&#x2019;s path in life as events unfold. Being hopeful for a new life&#x2014;growing stronger and confident&#x2014;following one&#x2019;s dreams can all be subtle insights or glimmers we are gifted with as we grow through the struggles or complications or just daily interactions of our lives. Each of the books in this series has inspired me with great joy and wisdom in navigating the events of my life.<br><br>The reconstruction years following the Civil War changed how people lived. These years were not even on my radar as far as imagining how events took place following so much loss of life, the rebuilding of the economy, and unfortunately experiencing racism and inequalities. I also was inspired by the shared passion and unity of stakeholders in fighting for equality. What I learned about myself is that I am not passionate enough to support issues existing in my world today! (I saw a glimmer for change).<br><br>The ensemble cast of characters demonstrated much growth in this year. Children were born, new love interests were uncovered, and the cruelty of racism and hatred made me almost physically sick. The descriptive artistry of the author&#x2019;s passages placed me curbside&#x2014;watching the unnecessary slaughtering of life in Memphis and New Orleans. I fact-checked these events and I am so pleased to report that the author not only captured factual details of these riots but she connected me to that time period as the characters I have grown to love were integrated into these events.<br><br>I never imagined reading seven books in so little time. I never expected to receive&nbsp;such joy from reading and yet I am so happy I am learning about this time in history, learning about myself, and being inspired to be more passionate about current issues in my life.</p></p><p><p>Ginny would love to get to know every single person who reads her books. Since that isn't possible she can at least let you get to know her a little. Born in North Carolina, she is a wanderer at heart.

She has managed horse ranches in Texas and Oregon; worked with teenagers all over the country (she love them!), and has hiked, biked, rafted and played in every locale she could. </p> <p>She loves all the beaches, deserts, woods, and mountains she has traveled through but when she discovered Washington, she discovered home. Her heart is at home there with the snow covered mountains; the glistening waters of the Pacific; the eagles and Orca whales; the towering fir trees surrounding her home; and the miles of trails on her own Magic Mountain. </p> <p>Everywhere she looks inspires her to be all she can be - to follow and achieve all the dreams of her heart! She managed to write and publish 16 books along the way. She enjoys writing many different genres but admits Historical Fiction is her favorite.

Using both reason and Scripture, Edwards determined that God created the world primarily as an arena for his eternal and innate glory to flow outward like a fountain and for his emanating glory to be received, praised, and enjoyed by the creatures he made. How he arrives at this answer is an amazing, worship-inducing journey. This version of Edward&#39;s classic treatise is a modern English paraphrase, designed to allow readers to meditate on the ideas Edwards illuminates rather than unraveling his long, dense sentences.</p><p>"This is what God aimed at when he created the world, and it can be summarized by that one overarching phrase - <i>the glory of God."</i>Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) was the pastor of Northampton Church in Massachusetts. He also served as a missionary and the president of the College of New Jersey (Princeton). His published writings are numerous and cover a broad range of topics including sermons, science, theology, philosophy, and even biography. Through these writings his towering influence continues to be felt today. He and his wife, Sarah, had eleven children. Jason Dollar (MA) is the pastor of Rock Mountain Lakes Baptist Church in McCalla, AL, where he lives with his wife, Page, and their five children.

In his trademark succinct style, Berger describes how automatic reflexes cause us to try to generate heat (shivering) or to get more oxygen (yawning). He also explains that the nervous system carries messages back and forth from the brain like telephone wires, and that these automatic reflexes help protect us from burning ourselves, from breathing in foreign objects, etc. In this new edition, the author suggests ways to test one's reflexes and describes "startle" reflexes and goose bumps. The writing is simple but effective, and the charming, colorful pen-and-ink and watercolors are much more detailed than the original black-and-white artwork by Holly Keller.

I wasn&#x2019;t born a princess or even a lady. But I was born in a castle built by dragons. Not that you would think so to look at it. Perched on the side of a mountain, the castle blazed like a diamond in the sun&#x2014;majestic, but ordinary as castles go. You wouldn&#x2019;t suspect that it had anything to do with dragons. Or magic. But it did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My mother was an Under-chopper, working beside the Under-slicer in the castle kitchens, when she had me. My father was a sailor who&#x2019;d been lost at sea. My grief-stricken mother spent her days chopping vegetables and sobbing. The day I was born, she kissed me good-bye, curled up her toes, and died. The Under-slicer, Jane, plucked me from my departed mother&#x2019;s side. She squinted nearsightedly at my wrinkled red face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What a Darling Dimple!&#x201d; she exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m told I screamed at this pronouncement, but it did me no good. The name stuck. Everyone from the Head Steward down to the Stable Boys called me Darling Dimple. Never mind that I didn&#x2019;t have a dimple. Nor was I particularly darling. My hair flew around like the white fluff of a dandelion. My skin was pasty, my nose stubby. My eyes were the color of water, which is to say they had no color whatsoever. Some folks said they were gray, some blue, some green. Roger, the Second Stable Boy, said they were yellow. But he didn&#x2019;t know anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For all her nearsightedness, Jane taught me to read, write, count, and wield a whetstone. She had a soft spot for me the size of a plum pie. When I was small, I followed her around the kitchens. I&#x2019;d hold a corner of her apron in one fist and a wooden spoon in the other. Just in case one of the cooks had a sudden need for a taster. As I grew older, I helped her: fetching vegetables from the bins, keeping count (if the Soup Chef said twelve onions, he meant twelve), and sanding the chopping block. At the end of the day, when every knife was sharpened, Jane took me upstairs to sit at the paws of one of the great bronze lions guarding the lower gardens. We gazed at the stars with the other Under-servants, dreaming of far away until it was time for bed. We slept in a room tucked under the kitchens where the air carried a hint of cinnamon and spice. But all that changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was ten and Jane&#x2019;s eyesight had dwindled to the near end of her nose, she accidentally cut off the tip of her finger. The Head Cook retired Jane from his service. The Head Steward gave her a new position with the Pickers, who gathered flowers from the gardens and arranged them in great bouquets for the Princess&#x2019;s tables. Jane was happy in the flower-scented sunshine. But I was too old to follow Jane around the gardens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Head Steward called me to his office. I stood quaking before his broad, polished desk. He sat ramrod-straight, drumming his desk with a pencil, his crimson uniform dripping with cords and tassels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; he rumbled, &#x201c;what shall we do with you?&#x201d; Dark eyes studied me from under bushy eyebrows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I gulped. I couldn&#x2019;t very well say that I wanted to do something big, something important. Something grand. A grand job would be exciting, an adventure. Ten-year-olds weren&#x2019;t offered grand jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes? Speak up.&#x201d; His pencil beat the polished wood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I caught my reflection in the surface. Some poor Under-duster spent hours slaving away with a rag and lemon oil to produce that sheen. I rubbed my elbow in sympathetic pain. I did not want to be an Under-duster&#x2014;or an Upper-duster, for that matter. Dust was dust wherever it might be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Head Steward rustled through a stack of papers, then pulled one out, clearing his throat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I could do Jane&#x2019;s job,&#x201d; I blurted out. I imagined myself surrounded by the savory smells of roasting meat, simmering spices, and baking bread, happily slicing carrots for the casserole. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly grand, but it wasn&#x2019;t dusting either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Under-slicer, sir,&#x201d; I added, in case he needed reminding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He blew his great bushy mustache out with a snort. &#x201c;Under-slicer! Under-slicer, indeed.&#x201d; He wagged his pencil at my nose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too young for such a lofty position as Under-slicer.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I was a b-big help to J-Jane,&#x201d; I protested, my vision of bubbling stews evaporating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2014;girl&#x2014;have to work your way up from the bottom just like everybody else.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I repressed a groan&#x2014;by bottom he meant the under-cellar. It was dark in the under-cellar. The Head Steward scribbled a note on a piece of paper. &#x201c;Take this to the Head Scrubber,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I bobbed a hasty curtsy and trudged off, holding my note like a soiled rag. The Head Scrubber, or the Supreme Scrubstress, as those in the under-cellar called her, was famous for her lack of imagination, and she was my new boss. Scrubbing was the lowest job in the castle&#x2014;and the least exciting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Supreme Scrubstress gave me a cot in a corner with a hook for my apron and a small wooden crate stamped artichokes, where I could keep my treasures. Had I any. Which I didn&#x2019;t. So began my life in the under-cellar. The cellar was packed with barrels, stacked with crates, lined with racks of wine bottles, and stuffed with sacks of potatoes. There was enough to feed everyone who lived in the castle, both the court upstairs and the servants below. Under all that, down a rickety wooden stair, was the under-cellar, a place of oil lamps, cobwebs, fires burning in great hearths, and vats of steaming water for scrubbing. Pots and pans went to one side and laundry went to the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I worked on the pots side in a steamy, soap-bubbly nook. Lye, soot, and ash stung my nose, like notes in a strong perfume. Warmth from the steaming water colored my cheeks a rosy hue and curled my wispy hair. My fingers wrinkled like prunes. Even though I wore my apron and rolled up my sleeves, I was wet most of the time. Droplets condensed out of the steam onto my hair. Splashes from my vigorous scrubbing dotted my skirt. It had to be vigorous&#x2014;the scrubbing&#x2014;because the Supreme Scrubstress was apt to patter up behind one on tiptoe, brandish her monstrous wooden-handled sponge, and swat an unsuspecting Scrubber on the behind to emphasize the sort of vigor she required. Her swats packed a wallop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dar-LING!&#x201d; she called in her shrill voice. Hair from her unraveling bun writhed around her face like tiny snakes. Her second chin wagged with her outrage; the rolls around her middle jiggled with her displeasure. &#x201c;Stop daydreaming and put some muscle into it!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;d bob my head and say, &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. I&#x2019;ll scrub harder, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; There was no point in arguing with her. Simply put, nothing less than well-applied elbow grease would dent the baked-on residue in the pots and pans. The sooner I worked my way through my share of pots, the sooner I could escape to the cool of the night air and indulge in a daydream or two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was lucky that I got to scrub pots&#x2014;the cooks sent the pots down as soon as the food was ladled into the serving bowls and platters. I was skip-happy free once I&#x2019;d hung up my apron. The poor dishwashers had to stay up until everyone had eaten and then wash their way through towering stacks of dishes, bowls, cups, and platters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first blaze of green spread over the gardens and, wham, a wave of feasts followed. Feast days were the worst; they lasted for hours. Every suitor for miles around came to the kingdom of Eliora by the White Sea to woo Princess Mariposa. Well, why not? Princess Mariposa had hair as dark as midnight, eyes as changeable as the sea, skin as white as snow, and lips as red as cherries. Or that&#x2019;s what the poets wrote. She was very pretty. And she had the whole kingdom all to herself. That&#x2019;s the sort of princess that even the laziest suitor will pursue. But every new suitor meant a boatload of work for the servants, from boot-polishing to dusting to laundry to . . . you guessed it, pots!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trail of pots down the rickety wood stairs was never ending. My fingers wrinkled to the bone, the steam peeled the tip of my nose, and my elbows creaked with the effort. Soap bubbles rose in the steamy air, shimmering in the lamplight. I&#x2019;d lift my sponge and touch one, lightly, just enough to set it rolling in the steam, careful not to break it. Then I would picture myself in the soap bubble, Darling the Mighty Sailor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I held fast to the rigging of my schooner, a spyglass in my free hand. A distant island beckoned her misty green fingers across the roaring sea. A fair jewel ahead! I&#x2019;d set a course for her and pry her treasures loose from those fingers. Ahoy! But the sea had other plans. Towering waves rolled the ship, pitching her from side to side. On the deck, my crew cried out to me to turn back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sail on!&#x201d; I crowed back at them. The wind tore at my hair. The sea spit foam. A clutch of black rocks leered at me from between the waves, gnashing their sharp teeth, anxious to tear into the tender planking of my schooner&#x2019;s side. I signaled to the wheelman. To starboard! To starboard! Gritting his teeth, he hung on the wheel, spinning her with all his might. The timbers creaked. The masts moaned. The sails whistled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The prow of my schooner slicked past the rocks&#x2014;by an inch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sea screamed in rage, but calm waters rode ahead. And the island held her breath, awaiting my arrival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a very pretty daydream indeed. All shimmery and glistening while the bubble lasted. And while it wasn&#x2019;t a real adventure, for a moment in the sooty dimness of the cellar, it made me feel that my life was as grand as Princess Mariposa&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, almost. While I scrubbed pots by lamplight, the Princess spent hours scouting the countryside for rare butterflies. Her collection filled an entire room, but still she prowled the woods, clutching a net, scrambling through bushes and over briars, a trail of servants behind her. All the while, the possibility of another rare butterfly fluttered just beyond her reach. The servants might grumble as they picked burs out of their stockings, but they&#x2019;d say that if the Princess wanted a Polyommatus bellargus, well then, she should have one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Princess Mariposa wore a crown that twinkled with diamonds, ate off golden plates, drank from crystal goblets, and rode in a golden carriage. She had a castle full of servants, a kingdom full of subjects, and an army of soldiers&#x2014;all to please and serve and protect her. She had everything a princess could need or desire and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because deep under her castle-built-by-dragons, in the under-cellar, she had a secret weapon: me, Darling Dimple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she didn&#x2019;t know it. And up until then, neither did I. She was about to need a secret weapon and I was about to have the kind of adventure I&#x2019;d dreamed of. Long afterward, she herself told me how on a feast day while I was scrubbing pots in the under-cellar she was wrinkling her pretty nose at the state of her petticoats. And that&#x2019;s how my adventure started, with Princess Mariposa&#x2019;s pretty wrinkled nose.</p></p><h2>Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped</h2><p><p><b>Russell Brand explores the idea of mentoring and shares what he's learned from the guidance of his own helpers, heroes and mentors.</b></p><p>Could happiness lie in helping others and being open to accepting help yourself? <i>Mentors </i>&#x2013; the follow up to the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Recovery </i>&#x2013; describes the benefits of seeking and offering help.</p><p><i>"I have mentors in every area of my life, as a comic, a dad, a recovering drug addict, a spiritual being and as a man who believes that we, as individuals and the great globe itself, are works in progress and that through a chain of mentorship we can improve individually and globally, together . . .

He lives in New York City.<br><br>S. D. Schindler lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Gr. 4-6. As in <i>The Cod's Tale</i> (2001), this author-illustrator team has again adapted an adult best-seller by Kurlansky into a picture book that brings astonishing history, science, and technology to middle-grade readers. The tone is occasionally condescending ("nearly 2000 years before!"), and some of the text, which is printed on the colored pictures, is not easy to read. But the informal narrative and the exquisitely detailed, sometimes playful ink-and-watercolor illustrations dramatize the sweeping world history of salt's essential role in human life--from prehistoric times and the early voyages of discovery through the breakthrough of refrigeration and the latest drilling technology. One unforgettable illustration shows defiant Gandhi leading thousands on his famous Salt March to the ocean to protest being forced to buy salt from the British. There's also a wry cartoon of Uncle Sam shaking a saltcellar on top of the globe, controlling the salt trade today. An illustrated time line sums up "Salt through the Centuries."

The three-month battle in the Pacific theater will feature some of the most vicious combat of the entire Second World War, as American troops confront an enemy that would rather be slaughtered than experience the shame of surrender. Meanwhile, stateside, a different kind of campaign is being waged in secret: the development of a weapon so powerful, not even the scientists who build it know just what they are about to unleash. Colonel Paul Tibbets, one of the finest bomber pilots in the U.S. Army Air Corps, is selected to lead the mission to drop the horrific new weapon on a Japanese city. As President Harry S Truman mulls his options and Japanese physician Okiro Hamishita cares for patients at a clinic near Hiroshima, citizens on the home front await the day of reckoning that everyone knows is coming.</p></p><p><b>A Letter from Author Jeff Shaara</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Though Hollywood has given us countless ways to dramatize the Second World War in the Pacific, the challenge for me was to bring to the reader a story that isn&#x2019;t simply a rehash of everything you&#x2019;ve heard before. And, where Hollywood is often less concerned with keeping the history accurate, I have always felt that if I&#x2019;m going to tell any story like this, &#x201c;getting it right&#x201d; is key. When dealing with World War II, my research often included conversations with living veterans, and ignoring their truth just to &#x201c;beef up&#x201d; the tale, does an incredible injustice to what those veterans accomplished. <p></p> In the Second World War, the Japanese were unlike any enemy we had ever faced, a very different enemy than the Germans. We had very little understanding of their culture, of how seriously they took their loyalty and obedience to their emperor, and we were completely unprepared for their willingness to die rather than accept the dishonor of surrender. For young soldiers and Marines who faced this determination, the fights often became a slaughter on a scale no one could have imagined. To put a nineteen year old boy into that position, and hope that he responds appropriately is not a typical method of training our young troops. <p></p> In researching <i>The Final Storm</i>, I was surprised to find a significant amount of humanity among the Japanese commanders whose voices became a vital part of this story. Okinawa was the last great stronghold that held the American wave away from Japan itself, and the Japanese troops assigned to defend the island country knew that there could be no retreat. The Americans who confronted them had to fight not only this extreme dedication, but the weather and the geography as well. A fight that was scheduled to last a month, took three. How and why are far more interesting to me than a simple history lesson. <p></p> If this story is not a history lesson, it is also not an exercise in blood and guts. That kind of story would get old very quickly. What has always drawn me to these stories are the characters. I am not concerned with giving you every detail of the numbers of casualties or the positions of troops. There are historians far more qualified to do that. My job as the storyteller is to find the voices that will carry you (along with me) into the story itself. My search is to find a story beneath the history lesson, to feel it, hear it, smell it, to explore not only the horror, but the laughter (and yes, there is laughter. There has to be.) What kind of thinking and agonizing goes into command decisions? What makes a nineteen year old Marine rise up from a muddy hole to drive forward into the enemy he cannot even see? <p></p> While much of <i>The Final Storm</i> focuses on the great struggle for Okinawa, this story does not end there. One more extraordinary drama must be played out, the story of how the Second World War actually ends: the dropping of the first atomic bombs. Through characters such as Paul Tibbets and General Curtis LeMay, I try to show just how much tension and how much mystery surrounded the bombs themselves. Consider that, to the young crews of the aircrafts that were to carry the bombs over Japan, none had any idea what would happen when the bombs were actually exploded, whether their own planes would disintegrate, along with the targets they were seeking. On the ground, the Japanese civilians had already experienced massive bombing strikes from American planes, and so, on that morning of August 6, 1945, the sight of a single B-29 bomber high in the clouds above causes no real concern. That point of view is here as well, a Japanese doctor who is weary of the war, of what he knows to be the propaganda being fed to the people by their military. And yet, he has his own duty to fulfill. <p></p> There are debates ongoing today about whether the United States did the &#x201c;right thing&#x201d; by ending the war the way we did. The decisions made by President Harry Truman are controversial even now. My job is not to anguish over morality, or debate what is politically correct. Ultimately I have one goal: to bring you the best and most accurate story I can, as told by those who were there. With so few veterans of World War Two remaining with us, I believe we must be reminded just why we owe them our thanks, and why their legacies must be remembered. I hope you enjoy the story. <p></p> --<i>Jeff Shaara, May 2011</i> <p></p><b>Jeff Shaara</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>A Chain of Thunder,</i>&nbsp;<i>A Blaze of Glory,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Final Storm, No Less Than Victory, The Steel Wave, The Rising Tide, To the Last Man, The Glorious Cause, Rise to Rebellion,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Gone for Soldiers,&nbsp;</i>as well as&nbsp;<i>Gods and Generals&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The Last Full Measure</i>&#x2014;two novels that complete the Civil War trilogy that began with his father&#x2019;s Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning classic,&nbsp;<i>The Killer Angels</i>.

Art Costa and Bob Garmston have provided an update on their seminal work in cognitive coaching, updating it in response to the culture of professional accountability and rigorous student learning standards. I appreciate particularly their application of coaching techniques to &#x201c;calibrating conversations,&#x201d; to help teachers internalize standards of practice, incorporating teachers&#x2019; own self-assessment into reflective conversations. This enables teachers themselves to drive the aspiration towards higher levels of teaching practice. The third edition, like its predecessors, is a major contribution to the field. (Charlotte Danielson, The Danielson Group)<br><br>Just when I thought I knew something about coaching, I read this book and my knowledge and my work was enlightened! Art and Bob are masterful coaches and, in this book they offer great clarity about the why, what, and how of coaching practices. The book combines the practical with the theoretical in an easy to read manner. I look forward to facilitating a book study on this one. It should foster new meanings for leaders in our schools.

This new edition describes the results of the latest research about the connection between cortisol and HSD, and cortisol and testosterone.</p><p><br>Cortisol. Who knew! Too little, or none.. and you have Addison's Disease and cannot handle stress without medication. Too much? Weight gain, IBS, joint pain, hair loss, and more.<br><br>This book not only outlines the problems caused by stress, which causes too much cortisol to be created by the body, but how to cope with it. Not only will you be informed about what and how much damage can be done to the body by too much stress/cortisol, but there are recommendations on how to change it. Nutrition, supplements to take or not to take? And of course a healthy diet and exercise are the among the answers.<br><br>This is not a gloom and doom book by any means. This is a book that explains a problem, and gives simple and often enjoyable approaches to controlling stress and the overproduction of this hormone. Read a trashy novel, soak in a hot tub, give yourself days off each week..hey, I can do that!<br><br>Often books that you think you should read to learn something you feel that you should know about are dry and dull and agonizing to get through. This one has bits of humor ( humans are not zebras!) and it presents information in such a clear and simple way that I was able to zip right through the pages, and make my way through it in 2 sittings.<br><br>Even though I have read it cover to cover, you can be sure that this is one that will spend a long time on my nightstand. I want it to be available for quick reference and reminders of what I should be doing and looking for. Not just a good and informative read, but by all means, a keeper! <b>- Kathleen Wagner, LibraryThing Early Reviewer </b>"Stress is killing us," warns Talbott, and "humans are not zebras": unlike the rest of the animal kingdom, our fight-or-flight reactions to physical and emotional disturbances can lead to prolonged, chronic stress and elevated levels of cortisol. Over the long term, excessive amounts of this "primary stress hormone" can "kill your sex drive, shrink your brain, squelch your immune system, and generally make you feel terrible." While Talbott freely admits that nearly as many ways to cope with stress exist as events and situations that cause it, his recommended solution to alleviating tension and achieving balanced cortisol levels is the SENSE program. These five principles-Stress management, Exercise, Nutrition, Supplements and Evaluation-aren't necessarily groundbreaking, but they're undoubtedly sensible. Talbott is a nutritionist, and thus the book's coverage of vitamins, minerals and adaptogens (general anti-stress supplements) is especially comprehensive, and includes important recommendations for safety and dosage levels. With features including a "Stress Self-Test," daily food plans and a guide to additional stress management resources, the text is organized for both quick reference use as well as for readers, especially health care workers, interested in conducting a more detailed exploration. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Poof!

He gathered himself, surged into the air, and bounded over the vertical with red-and-white-striped poles. We flew by the windows in the arena. Not even a hint of light came through&#x2014;it was barely five thirty in the morning. I&#x2019;d been at the stable since four forty-five.<br> <br>My chestnut gelding and I were the only ones here. Monday morning lessons for the advanced team wouldn&#x2019;t start for another hour or so. My chest tightened at the thought. Callie and Eric would be here soon.<br> <br>I urged Charm to keep up his canter. I didn&#x2019;t want to think about Callie, the best friend I&#x2019;d lied to in order to protect her from the truth and had lost anyway. And I couldn&#x2019;t even begin to think about Eric, my amazing ex-boyfriend who had witnessed something so horrible it had ruined our relationship and any possible chance of us getting back together. I&#x2019;d barely slept for the past two nights and I was edgy and exhausted&#x2014;ever since my little white lies had all come crashing down around me at my birthday party on Friday night.<br> <br>Charm and I had been practicing almost nonstop all weekend. It kept me busy and away from my other BFF and roommate Paige, who didn&#x2019;t believe my story about my initiating the kiss with Jacob. Paige wouldn&#x2019;t stop asking me about it, so I&#x2019;d spent as little time in our room as possible all weekend. But on Canterwood Crest Academy&#x2019;s campus, there were few places to escape.<br> <br>I looked up just as Heather Fox walked into the arena. Heather, the leader of the Trio, was my enemy most of the time, but she&#x2019;d helped me out the night of the party. I slowed Charm to a trot, then a walk.<br> <br>Heather&#x2019;s blond hair was pulled into a low ponytail and she had on black yoga pants and a casual T-shirt. She didn&#x2019;t have a lesson this morning, so why was she here?<br> <br>I stopped Charm in front of her.<br> <br>Heather folded her arms and started at me&#x2014;her ice-blue eyes seemed to cut right through my thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked her.<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>What</i> is that I get hard-core practicing, but you&#x2019;re being insane. If Mr. Conner caught you jumping alone&#x2014;you&#x2019;d be in so much trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Coming from <i>you</i>?&#x201d; I laughed, willing my voice to sound stronger than I felt. &#x201c;You practice all of the time. You&#x2019;re here more than anyone. And it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m on the cross-country course&#x2014;I&#x2019;m in the stable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Heather made an <i>Are you kidding me?</i> face. I silently agreed&#x2014;my argument was weak.<br> <br>Heather reached out and rubbed Charm&#x2019;s blaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m practicing because I <i>want</i> to. You&#x2019;re practicing because you&#x2019;re trying to ignore what happened on Friday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heather, I have nothing to do <i>but</i> ride. Who cares why I&#x2019;m doing it?&#x201d;<br> <br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Oh, puh-lease, Silver. Maybe you&#x2019;d have more options if you stopped spinning the I-kissed-my-best-friend&#x2019;s-boyfriend lie. Why aren&#x2019;t you telling Callie the truth?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It <i>is</i> the truth,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;I kissed Jacob. I cheated on Eric. Callie was crazy about Jacob and now she hates me. It is what it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>Heather stared at me for a long second. Like Paige, she&#x2019;d known I&#x2019;d been lying that night.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make the mistake that I care, because I don&#x2019;t, but you need to tell the truth. Paige and I know you&#x2019;re lying. Tell Callie what really happened&#x2014;whatever it is&#x2014;because it&#x2019;s going to come out eventually.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it couldn&#x2019;t. If Callie found out that Jacob had kissed me and had been trying to get me back since before summer vacation, she&#x2019;d be devastated. I&#x2019;d rather Callie lost our on-again-off-again friendship than her very first boyfriend who, when all was said and done, was a really amazing guy. Just a little ... confused.<br> <br>Charm shifted beneath me and I ran my hand down his neck. &#x201c;Callie&#x2019;s happy. She may hate me, but she&#x2019;s got Jacob.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then at least tell the truth,&#x201d; Heather said. &#x201c;The last thing I need to see is your mopey face every day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i> moping. Look, I just ...&#x201d; I shrugged, looking down at Charm instead of at Heather. &#x201c;I want to be by myself for a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>Heather raised her hands in an <i>I give up</i> gesture. &#x201c;Fine. Be alone. Be miserable because you have no friends. But <i>don&#x2019;t</i> let it affect the team. I&#x2019;m serious, Silver.&#x201d; She started to walk away, then turned back. Her gaze softened and her eyes weren&#x2019;t so piercing anymore. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t make the mistake I did last year. Riding can&#x2019;t be everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>She walked out of the arena. I took a breath and looked out the door after her. I could leave right now and go get ready for class. Charm was probably tired after three days of nonstop practicing.<br> <br>But instead, I turned him toward the arena&#x2019;s center and urged him into a trot. We had a few dressage moves to work on. There were plenty of other things to practice and I wouldn&#x2019;t be going back to my room until the last possible minute.<br> <br>Heather had been wrong about one thing&#x2014;riding <i>was</i> everything now.

McLaren followed his love of nature (specifically, tortoises) all the way to the Galapagos Islands. There, he paid close attention to the flora and fauna around him but also to what was happening within him, how the natural world awakened his soul in a way that organized religion could not. McLaren's descriptions of birds and reptiles, fish and flowers sing; he walks in the footsteps of Charles Darwin and grieves that Darwin has been demonized by his fellow Christians; and he reflects on how his own faith has evolved in the years since he left the pastorate.</p><p>McLaren writes in the spirit of Aldo Leopold and Wendell Berry, weaving together the spiritual and the material. Even though most readers will never visit the Galapagos Islands, they can travel with McLaren and experience the beauty and fragility of this extraordinary place.</p></p><p><p><b>Brian D.

He uses a new voice here to describe his own life-changing voyage. I found myself reading him in a whisper, if such a thing is possible, for fear of interrupting the flow of his gorgeous, intimate, and brilliant prose. My only caveat is this: do not read this book unless you are ready for your life to change too, for you will never see your place in the universe the same way again." --Barbara Brown Taylor, author of <i>An Altar in the World</i> <br><br> "Set among the birthplace of Darwin's world-shaping theory, McLaren lays out a possible evolution of the Christian faith that is simultaneously personal and socially responsible." --Mike McHargue, co-founder of The Liturgists <br><br> "This is a genial but sharp-eyed book that gets at some essential and difficult truths about our species at this late date in human history." --Bill McKibben, author of <i>Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?</i> <br><br> "McLaren takes a very personal journey as he traces the steps of Darwin. In doing so, he reveals that there is indeed 'grandeur in this view of life,' as first articulated by Darwin, and, more than that, there's reason to hope we can evolve as a species in this time of ecological collapse." --Tripp Fuller, founder and cohost of Homebrewed Christianity podcast</p><h2>The Art of Anne Stokes: Mystical, Gothic &amp; Fantasy (Gothic Dreams)</h2><p>Anne Stokes is a phenomenally popular artist in the field of gothic and magical fantasy, with fans all over the world.

Grandmother Kurnitz is a one-woman German front&#x2014;a refugee and a widow who has steeled her heart against the world. Her coldness and intolerance have crippled her own children: the boys&#x2019; father has no self-esteem; their Aunt Gert has an embarrassing speech impediment; their Uncle Louie is a small-time gangster; and their Aunt Bella has the mentality of a child. But it is Bella's hunger for affection and her refusal to be denied love that saves the boys&#x2014;and that leads to an unforgettable, wrenching confrontation with her mother.

The danger is that, once absorbed, iron can only be excreted in minute amounts of less than one milligram a day (or by heavy blood loss), and excess iron collects in a person&#39;s vital organs, thus, setting the disease process under way. As organs literally rust away, patients can experience early death by heart attack, arthritis, liver, pancreatic and colon cancer, increased infections, cirrhosis, diabetes, neurological problems, loss of hearing, tinnitus, depression, impotence, and infertility. Scientists have now discovered a connection to iron impropriety and Alzheimer&#39;s, early onset Parkinson&#39;s, Huntington&#39;s, attention deficit disorder, and epilepsy. EXPOSING THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF IRON is an excellent introduction for medical professionals to the intricacies of iron in the various body systems. Containing a practical guide to diagnosis, it also includes such subjects as the treatment and management of iron-loading conditions, excellent reference charts, a large glossary of terms, additional resources, contact and treatment centers, and a complete bibliography. Cutting edge scientific findings are summarized, complete with endnotes and references, about the devastation of excess iron on the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, bone marrow, arteries, heart, pituitary, joints, lungs, hearing, skin, vision, and the brain.</p><p>E. D. WEINBERG, professor of microbiology, emeritus, Indiana University, is world renowned for more than five decades of scientific publications about iron.

Wilson has written the most entertaining sci-fi thriller in years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not far into our future, the dazzling technology that runs our world turns against us. Controlled by a childlike&#x2014;yet massively powerful&#x2014;artificial intelligence known as Archos, the global network of machines on which our world has grown dependent suddenly becomes an implacable, deadly foe. At Zero Hour&#x2014;the moment the robots attack&#x2014;the human race is almost annihilated, but as its scattered remnants regroup, humanity for the first time unites in a determined effort to fight back. This is the oral history of that conflict, told by an international cast of survivors who experienced this long and bloody confrontation with the machines. Brilliantly conceived and amazingly detailed, <i>Robopocalypse</i> is an action-packed epic with chilling implications about the real technology that surrounds us.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2011</strong>:In the not-too-distant future, robots have made our lives a lot easier: they help clean our kitchens, drive our cars, and fight our wars--until they are turned into efficient murderers by a sentient artificial intelligence buried miles below the surface of Alaska. <i>Robopocalypse</i> is a fast-paced sci-fi thriller that makes a strong case that mindless fun can also be wildly inventive. The war is told as an oral history, assembled from interviews, security camera footage, and first- and secondhand testimonies, similar to Max Brook's zombie epic <i>World War Z</i>. The book isn't shy about admitting to its influences, but author Daniel H. Wilson certainly owes more to <i>Terminator</i> than he does to Asimov. (A film adaptation is already in pre-production, with Steven Spielberg in the director's chair and a release date slated for 2013.) <i>Robopocalypse</i> may not be the most unique tale about the war between man and machine, but it's certainly one of the most fun. --<i>Kevin Nguyen</i></p> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Robert Crais</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Robert Crais</strong> is the 2006 recipient of the Ross Macdonald Literary Award and the author of many </em>New York Times<em> bestsellers, including </em>The Watchman<em>, </em>Chasing Darkness<em>, </em>The First Rule<em>, and </em>The Sentry. <p><em>Robopocalypse</em> is as good as Michael Crichton's <em>Andromeda Strain</em> or <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and I do not invoke Mr. Crichton's name lightly.</p> <p>Daniel Wilson&#x2019;s novel is an end of the world story about a coming machine-versus-man war. You know the reader's clich�: &#x201c;I couldn't stop turning the pages&#x201d;? So shoot me--I couldn't. Started on a Friday afternoon, finished Sunday morning, and I'm slow. My daughter finished it in a single night, and then my wife. My wife <em>hates</em> science fiction, but she loved this book.</p> <p>Set in a future only a few weeks away, the world is still our world, where advancements in silicon-chip technology and artificial intelligence have given us rudimentary android laborers and cars that can get around without human drivers.</p> <p>The war begins the fourteenth time a scientist named Nicholas Wasserman wakes an amped-up artificial intelligence dubbed Archos. In a protected lab environment designed to contain his creation, Wasserman has awakened the sentient computer intelligence thirteen previous times, always with the same result: Archos realizes that it loves that rarest of miracles&#x2014;life--above all else, and to preserve life on Earth, it must destroy mankind. This wasn't exactly what Wasserman wanted to hear, so thirteen times before, a disappointed Wasserman killed it and returned to the drawing board. But unlike Archos, Wasserman is a man, and men make mistakes. Now, on this fourteenth awakening, a simple (but believable) error by the scientist allows Archos to escape the barrier of the lab. And the war is on.</p> <p>When Archos goes live, its control spreads like a virus as it reprograms the everyday devices of our lives, from cell phones to ATM machines to traffic lights to airliners. A normally benign "Big Happy" domestic robot murders a cook in a fast-food joint. A safety and pacification robot (think of an overgrown Ken doll with a dopey grin, designed to win hearts and minds) used by the army in Afghanistan (yes, we're still there) goes bad and kills dozens of people. And, in a particularly creepy scene, &#x201c;smart toys&#x201d; wake in their toy boxes at night to deliver ominous messages to children.</p> <p>The book is rich with high-speed-action set pieces and evocative, often frightening imagery (smart cars stalking pedestrians; human corpses reanimated by machines into zombie warriors), but <em>Robopocalype</em> is a terrific and affecting read because it is about human beings we can relate to, invest in, and root for.</p> <p>Among them: Cormac Wallace, a young photojournalist who escapes Boston at Zero Hour (the moment when Archos unleashes its machine army against humankind), and fights his way across the United States as the leader of a band of guerrillas known as the Brightboy squad. Takeo Nomura, a lonely technician in love with an android &#x201c;love doll&#x201d; named Mikiko, who, when she is reprogrammed by Archos, is driven by his love and sadness to fix her, an effort that will ultimately help turn the tide of the war. And Lurker, a pissed-off hacker and phone pranker furiously determined to identify the mysterious person who is taking the credit for his elaborate pranks . . . only to find himself in Archos's crosshairs and running for his life.</p> <p>Little by little, the discoveries they (and others) make and the battles they fight lead to locating Archos, and the final battle for humanity's survival. By choosing to show us these events through the eyes of the men and women involved, Wilson gives us a high-speed, real-time history of the war on its most human level, and it is our investment in these characters and their desperate struggle that grabs us and pulls us along at a furious clip.</p> <p>In lesser hands, the story could have been head-shot with pseudo-science technical jargon, overwrought explanation, and cartoonish characterizations. Instead, Wilson has given us a richly populated and thrilling novel that celebrates life and humanity, and the power of the human heart . . . even if that heart beats in a machine.</p> <p></p><b>A Q&amp;A with Author Daniel H. Wilson</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>You have your Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon. Having made the leap from studying robotics to creating an all-out robot Armageddon in <i>Robopocalype</i>, do you believe we will ever see a real robot uprising?</b> <br> My professional opinion is that robots are not going to rise up and slaughter humankind. Isn&#x2019;t that comforting? Instead, I believe the idea of a robot uprising embodies the thing that we&#x2019;re all <i>really</i> afraid of: our near total dependence on technology for survival. Billions of human beings are alive today thanks to an ancient, towering infrastructure of technology cobbled together over the ages. If this technology were to disappear--or worse, turn on us--how would we survive? <p></p> <b>You have said that <i>Robopocalypse</i> &#x201c;explores the intertwined fates of regular people who face a future filled with murderous machines.&#x201d; Cell phones, toy dolls, elevators, and even the &#x201c;Big Happy&#x201d; domestic robots turn on their owners and become creepily sinister. In terms of technological advances, are you concerned that computers or robots could eventually &#x201c;think&#x201d; on their own someday?</b><br> Machines of all shapes and sizes can already think on their own--and that is absolutely wonderful. A robot is only useful <i>because</i> it can think. Artificially intelligent machines make our cars safer, sniff out bombs, and build our favorite products. The sinister part only arrives when we consider that &#x201c;thinking&#x201d; also happens to be the only attribute that makes a <i>human</i> useful. I see why that can be a bit threatening, but I think there is plenty of room for thinkers here on planet earth. <p></p> <b>One of the most interesting robot battling groups in the book is the Osage Nation in Gray Horse, Oklahoma. You are part Cherokee and grew up in Tulsa. How did your upbringing shape the residents and setting of Gray Horse in the book?</b><br> In 1889, the United States government took Indian Territory away from Native Americans and gave it to settlers. Nevertheless, there are still dozens of sovereign Native American governments operating in Oklahoma. These mini-nations have their own governments, police forces, hospitals, jails, and laws &#x2013; all while co-existing with the US government. Growing up as part of the Cherokee Nation, I always felt that even if the wider world were to crumble, the nucleus of these tribal communities would hold firm. That&#x2019;s why in <i>Robopocalypse</i> the Osage Nation keeps operating as a bastion of humanity in the face of a total government meltdown. <p></p> <b>Robots are everywhere in our daily lives--from the military to our operating rooms to our self-parking cars--and permeate popular culture. Why do you think the public loves a robot story--be it <i>The Terminator</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Transformers</i> or <i>Wall-E</i>?</b><br> As a species, humankind is in love with its own reflection. People are interested in people. (That&#x2019;s why nobody cares for those great landscape shots in your vacation photos.) Robots are fascinating because they remind us of ourselves. In movies like <i>Terminator</i>, we see them as rivals who are capable of taking our world away from us and gaining supremacy. In other stories, like <i>Star Wars</i>, robots are integrated into our lives and cooperate as allies and tools. We love a robot story because the stakes are huge--these machines could eradicate us, or they could take us to the stars. <p></p> <b>Have you always been fascinated by robots? And while pursuing your doctorate, did you create any robots?</b><br> As a kid I dreamed about robots and as an adult I built them. Now, I write about them. In school, I designed artificially intelligent &#x201c;smart homes&#x201d; that monitored their elderly occupants to help them live safely and independently. I also helped build an autonomous boat; designed multi-robot systems that exhibited swarm behavior to search for disaster survivors; and tailored a machine learning algorithm to detect (and remove) bathroom sounds from cell phone conversations. Each of these problems was different, but the solution was always the same: a machine with some brains. Robotics is truly the Swiss army knife of the sciences. <p></p> <b>Your protagonist, Cormac Wallace, discovers the black box of the robot uprising at the opening of the book. Cormac compiles the stories and lets them unfold in the distinct voices of the heroes of &#x201c;Zero Hour&#x201d; starting a full year before the robots ever attack. Why was this technique essential to the telling of <i>Robopocalypse</i>?</b><br> The story starts out a year before Zero Hour because my goal was to root the characters and events in a familiar place with relatable characters, and <i>then</i> proceed step-by-step into the nightmare of automated war. I intentionally included very little science fiction up front. That&#x2019;s the scariest part of <i>Robopocalypse</i>--that it&#x2019;s <i>feasible</i>. There are no glinting robot armies from outer space, just the ordinary technology of our lives turning on us, ripping apart our civilization, and then <i>evolving</i> into something that human beings never intended. <p></p> <b> The ethical impact of robots on society is attracting serious consideration. A 2009 <i>New York Times</i> article (&#x201c;Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man&#x201d;) reported on a debate between top computer scientists on whether robotics research should be limited. Do you agree?</b><br> Robots <i>can</i> be dangerous. For example, a titanium-clawed hexapod once savaged a friend of mine at the Robotics Institute (though in all fairness, the climbing robot simply mistook him for a tree and climbed him). Then again, any tool can be dangerous. Robots are particularly tricky to safeguard, because they act in the real world without supervision; they can learn new behaviors on the fly; and they are often stronger, faster, and smarter than human beings. These points must be taken into consideration while building robots, but we should also remember that these are exactly the attributes that make robots incredibly powerful tools. With that in mind, promise should never limit research. <p></p> <b>The arrival of robots often conjures up thoughts of doomsday scenarios. Yet robots are rapidly improving the lives of humans with each passing year. Why do you think the fear impulse kicks in?</b><br> It&#x2019;s a question of trust. Never before has humankind trusted non-humans with the level of responsibility that machines now have. We humans are a cooperative species and we naturally work together, but we also <i>understand</i> each other. We have emotions, language, body language, and so on. We are experts at reading each others&#x2019; minds. On the other hand, robots do things that people used to do, but the machines can be inscrutable. We just aren&#x2019;t <i>used to</i> the machines--not yet. How do you trust a waiter that&#x2019;s got a smile permanently stamped on its plastic face? <p></p> <b>DreamWorks purchased the film rights to <i>Robopocalype</i> and last November they announced that Steven Spielberg will direct the film version. Can you describe the day you heard the news and what that felt like? How involved will you be with the movie version?</b><br> The movie news was an emotional overload: waves of happiness followed by pangs of terror that this is all somehow a cruel joke on the guy who loves robots. Luckily, the filmmakers have consistently consulted me on the design of their robots, exoskeletons, and a whole spectrum of other technology. I wrote it, but they have to draw it, see how it moves--make it <i>real</i>. It&#x2019;s been a ridiculous pleasure to be a part of this process. Based on the robot ecology that DreamWorks has built, I cannot wait to see this movie. <p></p> <b>Since completing <i>Robopocalypse</i>, what changes or developments in artificial intelligence and robotics have struck you, and would you have written the book differently if you started today?</b><br> I hope the book will stand on its own for a long, long time, regardless of new advances in robotics. And I think there&#x2019;s a good chance it will, because many real-world developments in robotics are simply <i>too</i> fantastic. In just the medical domain, consider bacteria-sized robots that can swim in your bloodstream; flea-sized robots that can locomote over the surface of a beating heart; or micron-sized teams of robots that can cooperate with each other. All of these robots exist today, and yet I considered them too &#x201c;out there&#x201d; and distracting to include in <i>Robopocalypse</i>. <p></p> <b>Steel cage deathmatch: C-3PO versus Bishop from <i>Aliens</i>. Who wins and why?</b><br> C-3PO is an awkward, shuffling golden protocol droid and Bishop is a rugged Alien-fighting android willing to be ripped to shreds to complete his mission. Based on Bishop&#x2019;s dogged determination, lack of complaining, and incredible knife-play, I predict he would slice Threepio into golden ribbons. <p></p></p><h2>Stay Fit for Life: More than 60 Exercises to Restore Your Strength and Future-Proof Your Body</h2><p><p><b>Future-proof your body and restore strength and mobility to everyday movements with 62 functional exercises, targeted workout routines, and three four-week fitness programs!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> They say 50 is the new 40, and you can make that a reality with streamlined functional training that is designed specifically for seniors and baby boomers! <i>Stay Fit for Life</i> empowers you to move with more ease and efficiency when performing functional movements such as bending, twisting, pushing, pulling, and reaching, to make everyday activities such as running, gardening, or playing with grandchildren both easier and more enjoyable.

Fifty years later, Viking proudly celebrates Peter's adventure in this very special edition. Featuring eight pages of bonus material and a festive cover, this oversized edition of Keats's beloved book is a must-have.</p><p><p><i>The Snowy Day</i>, a 1963 Caldecott Medal winner, is the simple tale of a boy waking up to discover that snow has fallen during the night. Keats's illustrations, using cut-outs, watercolors, and collage, are strikingly beautiful in their understated color and composition. The tranquil story mirrors the calm presence of the paintings, and both exude the silence of a freshly snow-covered landscape. The little boy celebrates the snow-draped city with a day of humble adventures--experimenting with footprints, knocking snow from a tree, creating snow angels, and trying to save a snowball for the next day. Awakening to a winter wonderland is an ageless, ever-magical experience, and one made nearly visceral by Keats's gentle tribute. </p><p>The book is notable not only for its lovely artwork and tone, but also for its importance as a trailblazer. According to <i>Horn Book</i> magazine, <i>The Snowy Day</i> was "the very first full-color picture book to feature a small black hero"--yet another reason to add this classic to your shelves. It's as unique and special as a snowflake.</p>Waking up to a world of snowy white - what could be better? Young Peter can&#39;t wait to jump in his snowsuit and run out to explore.

And when the day is done, there&#39;s a dark night of dreams and drifting snow, and a new snowy day to awake to. No book has captured the magic and sense of possibility of the first snowfall better than The Snowy Day, winner of the Caldecott Medal.</p><h2>The Best Book of Useless Information Ever: A Few Thousand Other Things You Probably Don&#39;t Need to Know (But Might as Well Find Out)</h2><p><b>From the creators of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Book of Useless Information</i> comes another enlightening, entertaining, and ultimately useless assortment of trivia.</b> <br><br> If you find yourself transfixed by the most trivial of trivia, or mesmerized by the most minor of minutiae, <b>The Useless Information Society</b>'s latest findings can satisfy your every need.

As the title indicates, this is a comprehensive text that includes topics not always covered in similar texts, including the history of assessment in student affairs, the importance of epistemology or &#x2018;ways of knowing&#x2019; when it comes to thinking about assessment, the politics of assessment, and the uses of technology in practice. Henning and Roberts&#x2019; text would be ideal for course instruction as it covers theory to practice and could be taught in the order best suited for the class. Course instructors may choose to create assignments tethered to key points and discussion questions provided by the authors.&#x201d; (Teachers College Record 2018-04-25)<br><br>&#x201c;If my graduate program curriculum had included an assessment course, I would have liked for this new book from Henning and Roberts to be the text. And as I prepare to introduce a position dedicated to assessment and storytelling into my Student Affairs portfolio in the coming months, I&#x2019;ll certainly purchase this book as a resource for our staff. Accessible to assessment newcomers and useful for seasoned professionals, <i>Student Affairs Assessment: Theory to Practice</i> belongs in Student Affairs libraries everywhere.&#x201d; (John Austin, Executive Director, Student Affairs, Ryerson University 2015-12-01)<br><br>"Rigor in implementing assessment is emphasized throughout this volume.

Richard Shell and Mario Moussa know what it takes to drive new ideas through complex organizations. They have advised thousands of executives from companies such as Google, Microsoft, and General Electric to organizations like the World Bank and even the FBI's hostage rescue training program. In <i>The Art of Woo</i>, they present their systematic, four- step process for winning over even the toughest bosses and most skeptical colleagues. Beginning with two powerful self-assessments to help readers find their "Woo IQ," they show how relationship-based persuasion works to open hearts and minds.<br><br>"Ranging across history, from Charles Lindbergh to Sam Walton, the authors examine how savvy negotiators use persuasion - not confrontation-to achieve goals."&nbsp;-<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report<br></i></p><p>G. Richard Shell teaches negotiation at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he is professor of legal studies, business ethics, and management and academic director of the Wharton Executive Negotiation Workshop.Shell and Moussa, both on the Wharton School faculty, aim to help readers get attention and sell their ideas through strategic relationship-based persuasion, or "woo"-or "winning others over." The authors consider wooing to be one of the most important skills in a manager's repertoire; while the concept may seem simple, mastering it is an art. The challenge is in striking a balance between what the authors identify as the "self-oriented" perspective-where focus is on the persuader's credibility and point of view-and the "other-oriented" perspective, which focuses on the audience's needs, perceptions and feelings. Drawing on their experience in teaching executives to negotiate, the authors examine the most important moments of influence and provide a four-step process to achieving goals: survey your situation, confront the five barriers, make your pitch and secure your commitments. They offer a practical guide to improving one's wooing skills, highlighting successes and failures from history and the present day. An entertaining and useful guide to acquiring the power of woo, this book will help readers beyond the professional realm.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Our answer must consist not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.<br><br>When <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> was first published in 1959, it was hailed by Carl Rogers as "one of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought in the last fifty years." Now, more than forty years and 4 million copies later, this tribute to hope in the face of unimaginable loss has emerged as a true classic. <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>--at once a memoir, a self-help book, and a psychology manual-is the story of psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's struggle for survival during his three years in Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. Yet rather than "a tale concerned with the great horrors," Frankl focuses in on the "hard fight for existence" waged by "the great army of unknown and unrecorded." <br><br>Viktor Frankl's training as a psychiatrist allowed him a remarkable perspective on the psychology of survival. In these inspired pages, he asserts that the "the will to meaning" is the basic motivation for human life. This simple and yet profound statement became the basis of his psychological theory, logotherapy, and forever changed the way we understand our humanity in the face of suffering. As Nietzsche put it, "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." Frankl's seminal work offers us all an avenue to greater meaning and purpose in our own lives-a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the act of living.</p><p><b>Viktor E. Frankl</b>&nbsp;was professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Vienna Medical School until his death in 1997. His twenty-nine books have been translated into twenty-one languages. During World War II, he spent three years in Auschwitz, Dachau, and other concentration camps.One of the ten most influential books in America. &#x2014;Library of Congress/Book-of-the-Month Club "Survey of Lifetime Readers"<br><br>"Viktor Frankl's timeless formula for survival. One of the classic psychiatric texts of our time, <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> is a meditation on the irreducible gift of one's own counsel in the face of great suffering, as well as a reminder of the responsibility each of us owes in valuing the community of our humanity. There are few wiser, kinder, or more comforting challenges than Frankl's." &#x2014;Patricia J. Williams, author of <i>Seeing a Color-Blind Future: The Paradox of Race</i><br><br>"Dr. Frankl's words have a profoundly honest ring, for they rest on experiences too deep for deception...&nbsp;A gem of a dramatic narrative, focused upon the deepest of human problems." &#x2014;Gordon W.

That obsession led James to a successful career as an investigative journalist. It also gave him PTSD. In 2011, James began researching the strange disappearance of Maura Murray, a UMass student who went missing after wrecking her car in rural New Hampshire in 2004. Over the course of his investigation, he uncovers numerous important and shocking new clues about what may have happened to Maura, but also finds himself in increasingly dangerous situations with little regard for his own well-being. As his quest to find Maura deepens, the case starts taking a toll on his personal life, which begins to spiral out of control. The result is an absorbing dual investigation of a complicated case that has eluded authorities for more than a decade and a journalist&#x2019;s own complicated true-crime addiction.</p></p><p><b>JAMES RENNER</b> is the author of <i>The Serial Killer's Apprentice</i> and several other works of nonfiction.

Fast-paced and highly entertaining, <i>Banana</i> takes us from jungle to supermarket, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables around the world. We begin in the Garden of Eden&#x2014;examining scholars&#x2019; belief that Eve&#x2019;s &#x201c;apple&#x201d; was actually a banana&#x2014; and travel to early-twentieth-century Central America, where aptly named &#x201c;banana republics&#x201d; rose and fell over the crop, while the companies now known as Chiquita and Dole conquered the marketplace. Koeppel then chronicles the banana&#x2019;s path to the present, ultimately&#x2014;and most alarmingly&#x2014;taking us to banana plantations across the globe that are being destroyed by a fast-moving blight, with no cure in sight&#x2014;and to the high-tech labs where new bananas are literally being built in test tubes, in a race to save the world&#x2019;s most beloved fruit.</p><p><b>Dan Koeppel</b>, a 2011 James Beard Award winner, is a science and nature writer who has written for <i>National Geographic, Outside, Scientific American, Wired</i>, and other national publications. He has discussed bananas on NPR&#x2019;s <i>Fresh Air </i>and <i>Science Friday.</i>The world's most humble fruit has caused inordinate damage to nature and man, and <i>Popular Science</i> journalist Koeppel (<i>To See Every Bird on Earth</i>) embarks on an intelligent, chock-a-block sifting through the havoc. Seedless, sexless bananas evolved from a wild inedible fruit first cultivated in Southeast Asia, and was probably the apple that got Adam and Eve in trouble in the Garden of Eden. From there the fruit traveled to Africa and across the Pacific, arriving on U.S. shores probably with the Europeans in the 15th century. However, the history of the banana turned sinister as American businessmen caught on to the marketability of this popular, highly perishable fruit then grown in Jamaica. Thanks to the building of the railroad through Costa Rica by the turn of the century, the United Fruit company flourished in Central America, its tentacles extending into all facets of government and industry, toppling banana republics and igniting labor wars. Meanwhile, the Gros Michel variety was annihilated by a fungus called Panama disease (Sigatoka), which today threatens the favored Cavendish, as Koeppel sounds the alarm, shuttling to genetics-engineering labs from Honduras to Belgium. His sage, informative study poses the question fairly whether it's time for consumers to reverse a century of strife and exploitation epitomized by the purchase of one banana. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In&nbsp;this gripping and ultimately profound book,&nbsp;Kotlowitz takes us to two towns in southern Michigan, St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, separated by the St. Joseph River. Geographically close, but worlds apart, they are a living metaphor for America's racial divisions: St. Joseph is a prosperous lakeshore community and ninety-five percent white, while Benton Harbor is impoverished and ninety-two percent black. When the body of a black teenaged boy from Benton Harbor is found in the river, unhealed wounds and suspicions between the two towns' populations surface as well. The investigation into the young man's death becomes, inevitably, a screen on which each town projects their resentments and fears.&nbsp;<i>The Other Side of the River</i>&nbsp;sensitively portrays the lives and hopes of the towns' citizens as they wrestle with this mystery--and reveals the attitudes and misperceptions that undermine race relations throughout America.</p><p>The author of <i>There Are No Children Here</i> follows up that magnificent effort with the gripping story of a mysterious death in southwest Michigan. A black teenager surfaces in the St. Joseph River, drowned. How did he get there? The towns of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, divided by both race and the river, grapple with the possibilities in this maddeningly difficult case. Alex Kotlowitz puts his sharp reporting skills to good work here, describing in detail everything that is known about Eric McGinnis's short life and untimely death.

A wild ride....I loved it. It hooked me and I couldn&#x2019;t put it down.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Mike Mignola, creator of <em>Hellboy</em></strong></p><p><strong>"Brom is that rare breed: a person who is skilled in more than one area of artistic expression. Here's hoping that he will continue to share his dark and often beautiful dreams with us for many years to come." Christopher Paolini, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>Eragon</em></strong></p><p>Acclaimed author and artist Brom raised eyebrows and pulse rates with <em>The Child Thief</em>, his grim, brilliantly audacious, gorgeously illustrated reimagining of the Peter Pan legend. So what does this innovative fantasist do for an encore? He tinkers darkly with the beloved mythology of Santa Claus. Set in Appalachia, <em>Krampus the Yule Lord</em> is a twisted fairytale about a failed West Virginia songwriter who gets ensnared on Christmas Eve in an eternal war between a not-so-saintly Saint Nick and his dark enemy Krampus, aka Black Peter, an ancient trickster demon. <em>Krampus the Yule Lord</em> is Gregory Maguire (<em>Wicked</em>) meets Susanna Clarke (<em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</em>) in the realm of Guillermo Del Toro&#x2019;s <em>Pan&#x2019;s Labyrinth</em>, as Clive Barker (<em>Mr. B. Gone</em>) works his dark sorcery from the shadows. Once again featuring Brom&#x2019;s chillingly beautiful artwork throughout, <em>Krampus the Yule Lord</em> is a feast of wonder straight from the kitchen of Sweeney Todd.</p></p><p><p><em>Santa Claus, my dear old friend, you are a thief, a traitor, a slanderer, a murderer, a liar, but worst of all you are a mockery of everything for which I stood. You have sung your last ho, ho, ho, for I am coming for your head. . . . I am coming to take back what is mine, to take back Yuletide . . .</em></p><p>The author and artist of <em>The Child Thief</em> returns with a modern fabulist tale of Krampus, the Lord of Yule and the dark enemy of Santa Claus</p><p>One Christmas Eve in a small hollow in Boone County, West Virginia, struggling songwriter Jesse Walker witnesses a strange spectacle: seven devilish figures chasing a man in a red suit toward a sleigh and eight reindeer. When the reindeer leap skyward, taking the sleigh, devil men, and Santa into the clouds, screams follow. Moments later, a large sack plummets back to earth, a magical sack that thrusts the down-on-his-luck singer into the clutches of the terrifying Yule Lord, Krampus. But the lines between good and evil become blurred as Jesse's new master reveals many dark secrets about the cherry-cheeked Santa Claus, including how half a millennium ago the jolly old saint imprisoned Krampus and usurped his magic.</p><p>Now Santa's time is running short, for the Yule Lord is determined to have his retribution and reclaim Yuletide. If Jesse can survive this ancient feud, he might have the chance to redeem himself in his family's eyes, to save his own broken dreams . . . and to help bring the magic of Yule to the impoverished fold of Boone County.</p><p>Over the past few decades, Brom has lent his distinctive vision to all facets of the creative industries, from novels and games to comics and film. He is the author of <em>The Child Thief</em> and the award-winning illustrated horror novels <em>The Plucker</em> and <em>The Devil's Rose</em>. Brom is currently kept in a dank cellar somewhere just outside of Seattle.</p></p><h2>Dual Transformation: How to Reposition Today&#39;s Business While Creating the Future</h2><p><p><strong>Game-changing disruptions will likely unfold on your watch. Be ready.</strong></p> <p>In <em>Dual Transformation</em>, Scott Anthony, Clark Gilbert, and Mark Johnson propose a practical and sustainable approach to one of the greatest challenges facing leaders today: transforming your business in the face of imminent disruption. <em>Dual Transformation</em> shows you how your company can come out of a market shift stronger and more profitable, because the threat of disruption is also the greatest opportunity a leadership team will ever face. Disruptive change opens a window of opportunity to create massive new markets. It is the moment when a market also-ran can become a market leader. It is the moment when business legacies are created.</p> <p>That moment starts with the core dual transformation framework:</p> <li><strong>Transformation A:</strong> Repositioning today&#x2019;s business to maximize its resilience, such as how Adobe boldly shifted from selling packaged software to providing software as a service.</li> <li><strong>Transformation B:</strong> Creating a new growth engine, such as how Amazon became the world&#x2019;s largest provider of cloud computing services.</li> <li><strong>Capabilities link:</strong> Fighting unfairly by taking advantage of difficult-to-replicate assets without succumbing to the &#x201c;sucking sound of the core.&#x201d; <br><br>Anthony, Gilbert, and Johnson also address the characteristics leaders must embrace: courage, clarity, curiosity, and conviction. Without them, dual transformation efforts can founder.<br><br>Building on lessons from diverse companies, such as Adobe, Manila Water, and Netflix, and a case study from Gilbert&#x2019;s firsthand experience transforming his own media and publishing company, <em>Dual Transformation</em> will guide executives through the journey of creating the next version of themselves, allowing them to own the future rather than be disrupted by it. </li></p><p><b>Scott Anthony</b> is the managing partner of the innovation and growth consulting firm Innosight.

All the while, malevolent forces gather from every corner in a battle for the very soul of a nation--a fight that could claim the Diviners themselves.</p><p>Heart-pounding action and terrifying moments will leave you breathless in the third book of the four-book Diviners series by #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Libba Bray.</p></p><p></p><h2>Far and Away: A Prize Every Time</h2><p><p>Presents a serialized autobiography describing the author's life, including his career in the band Rush and his motorcycling adventures throughout North America and Europe.</p></p><p><p>Neil Peart is the drummer and lyricist of the legendary rock band Rush and the author of "Ghost Rider," "The Masked Rider," "Roadshow," and "Traveling Music." He lives in Los Angeles.</p>JULY 2007<p></p><p>With only a few days at home after the first leg of the <i>Snakes and Arrows</i> tour (sixteen shows, 7,257 miles of motorcycling), this will definitely be the &#x201c;short version.&#x201d; Still, I wanted to try to put up <i>something</i> new.</p><p>Photographs of the performances are plentifully available elsewhere (my view of the audience this tour is studded with innumerable cell&#x2013;phone cameras, sticking up like periscopes), so I thought I might just display a couple of motorcycling photos. On this tour Michael and I haven&#x2019;t even carried cameras with us on the bikes, let alone bothered to ease our steady pace to take photos, but recently we had a camerahappy &#x201c;guest rider,&#x201d; Richard S. Foster. The name might ring a bell to dedicated readers of album credits&#x2014;our song &#x201c;Red Barchetta&#x201d; had a note on the lyric sheet: &#x201c;Inspired by &#x2018;A Nice Morning Drive&#x2019; by Richard S. Foster.&#x201d;</p><p>Rick (as he is known to his friends, among whom I now number myself) tells our long story in another forum, and it&#x2019;s quite an amazing sequence of coincidences and synchronicities. (See photo credits for details.)</p><p>The short version (I keep saying that) is that despite my attempts back in 1980 to contact the author of the short story that had inspired &#x201c;Red Barchetta&#x201d;&#x2014;a story I had read in a 1973 issue of <i>Road &amp; Track</i>&#x2014; we only recently managed to actually make contact.</p><p>Rick rode with Michael and me through the back roads (the very back roads) of West Virginia for a couple of days between shows in near&#x2013; D.C. and near&#x2013;Pittsburgh (so many of those amphitheaters are in the exurbs), and then he attended his first Rush concert in (or <i>near</i>) Boston.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s his story, and I&#x2019;ll leave it to him to tell. Michael only left Rick with one request, from the movie <i>Almost Famous</i>, when the singer says to the young journalist, &#x201c;Just make us look cool.&#x201d;</p><p>(How well Rick succeeded with that challenge, the reader may judge by his story.)</p><p>For Michael and me, it was great just to have some photographs of us riding&#x2014;something we do every day, after all, so it is nice to have it documented like that. After last tour, when I was constantly so intent on note&#x2013;gathering for the book that became <i>Roadshow</i>, this time I have been feeling a real sense of freedom&#x2014;the freedom of not having to document anything. I can simply experience it, think about it or not, and let the day flow by me as it will.</p><p>That being said, so far this tour has certainly been worthy of a book, too, in its way. I kind of wish someone else was writing one about it, but I don&#x2019;t think it will be me. My journal notes consist only of our daily mileages&#x2014;though I couldn&#x2019;t resist noting a couple of church signs: &#x201c;GIVE SATAN AN INCH, SOON HE&#x2019;LL BE A RULER,&#x201d; and one I just love: &#x201c;TO ERR IS HUMAN, BUT IT CAN BE OVERDONE.&#x201d; So good. And I admire it not only for the worthy sentiment, but for the perfect phrasing, too.</p><p>Another church sign caught my eye because of the word &#x201c;faithless,&#x201d; as in our song on <i>Snakes and Arrows</i>. This one seemed kind of mean, though: &#x201c;AND JESUS REPLIED, SAYING, &#x2018;YOU ARE A FAITHLESS AND PERVERSE GENERATION.&#x2019;&#x201d; I assured Michael that he was the only one of us who was <i>both</i>.</p><p></p></p><h2>Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite: The Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours</h2><p>At last, a complete ceremonial manual for the celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. <i>Exalting Jesus in Ezra-Nehemiah</i> is written by Jim Hamilton.<br></p><p><b>James M. Hamilton</b> is Professor of Biblical Theology at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, KY. Before coming to Southern, Dr. Hamilton served as Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary's Houston campus and was the preaching pastor at Baptist Church of the Redeemer.

Duesing, Ph.D.</b><br> Vice President for Strategic Initiatives and Assistant Professor of Historical Theology, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.&nbsp;<br> It's one thing to know Bible stories; it's another to know the story of the Bible. It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus.

His comments help inspire us to do that with increased attention and fervor.&nbsp;* * * * * * * * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In your introduction, rather than jumping right into the books, you ask your reader to imagine God building a theater. How does that picture help establish your aims for this commentary on Ezra and Nehemiah?</b>&nbsp;Ezra and Nehemiah can be difficult because the authors assume their audience will know the backstory and the importance of the places in which these books are set. That introduction was my attempt to summarize the storyline that leads up to Ezra&#x2013;Nehemiah in a way that captures the significance of the settings.&nbsp;We can put Shakespeare and Calvin together on this point: all the world's a stage, and the stage stands in the theater of God's glory. To understand Ezra&#x2013;Nehemiah we have to understand their setting and their contribution to the wider narrative. These authors are assuming their audience will plug their books into the ramshackle narrative begun in earlier Scripture, and they assume their audience will ponder the significance of Israel having returned to the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakespeare's plays were enacted in the Globe theater as he held the mirror up to nature. The biblical authors set their stories in the real world, and they tell its true story. God built this theater "as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in [Christ]. . . . so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places" (Eph. 1:10;&nbsp;3:10). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The temple rebuilding and rituals are so central in both these books. Could you offer a few summary comments about how we believers today, with no temple in sight, should relate to all these passage about the temple?</b>&nbsp;This is a fascinating aspect of the Bible's theology. After the exodus, Israel used the plundered wealth of Egypt to build the tabernacle. David was not allowed to build the temple, but he set Solomon up to do it by amassing great plunder from the Gentiles he conquered (1 Chron. 29:2&#x2013;5). In Psalm 68, David brings the building of tabernacle and temple together as he describes the way the building of the temple on Mount Zion means that "Sinai is now in the sanctuary" (Ps. 68:17), then speaks of the use of enemy plunder in the building of God's dwelling place (68:18). In keeping with this pattern, Ezra 1&#x2013;6 describes how the pagan kings Cyrus and Darius used their wealth to pay for the rebuilding of the temple (Ezra 1:1&#x2013;11; 6:1&#x2013;15). God repeatedly builds his dwelling place with enemy plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, scion of David, came as a carpenter, a builder, asserting that he would build his church (Matt. 16:18). When Paul describes how Christ built the church, he says that Jesus built the church the same way Moses built the tabernacle and Solomon built the temple: with the plunder of the enemy. Paul quotes Psalm 68:18 in Ephesians 4:8 to capture this point, as he describes the way that Jesus came down, bound the strong man, plundered his house, then "gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry" (Eph. 4:11&#x2013;12). And the body of Christ is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 3:16).&nbsp;&nbsp;So under the old covenant in the days of Ezra&#x2013;Nehemiah, God dwelt in the temple by his Spirit, and the focal point of God's cause in the world was his dwelling place. Now that Christ has inaugurated the new covenant and the church is the dwelling place of God by the Spirit, the focal point of God's cause in the world is the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Believers today can be encouraged to be as zealous for the upbuilding of the church as Ezra and Nehemiah were for the rebuilding of temple and wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You're not afraid to use leaders like Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah as examples to learn from&#x2014;and yet you consistently set the text in its larger redemptive context. How have you learned to balance these various approaches?</b>&nbsp;I hope I've learned this approach from the biblical authors themselves! I've also had good teachers, like Tom Schreiner, who helped me see it. Paul uses Israel as a negative example ("we must not . . . as some of them did") in 1 Corinthians 10:6&#x2013;10, concluding in&nbsp;10:11, "Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction." James uses Old Testament figures as examples, exhorting his audience to steadfast patience: "As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job" (James&nbsp;5:10&#x2013;11, cf. 5:7&#x2013;9).&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter calls believers to follow in the footsteps of Jesus (1 Pet. 3:21) as they endure unjust suffering. Across the Old Testament we see many key figures whose experience of unjust suffering anticipated Jesus, who fulfilled the pattern of the righteous sufferer.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to read the biblical narratives as their authors intended them to be read: they contribute to the grand narrative that begins at creation and consummates in new creation, and they are "written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom. 15:4). &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What do you especially love about the books of Ezra and Nehemiah?</b>&nbsp;That in his weeping over the sin of the people (Ezra 10:1), Ezra anticipates the one who would weep over Jerusalem (Luke&nbsp;19:41).&nbsp;&nbsp;That in his cleansing of the temple (Neh. 13:8&#x2013;9), Nehemiah anticipates the one who would do that too (Mark&nbsp;11:15&#x2013;19).&nbsp;&nbsp;I love that Ezra&#x2014;who holds an important post in the Persian Empire&#x2014;sets his heart to study, do, and teach the Torah of Yahweh (Ezra&nbsp;7:10).&nbsp;&nbsp;I love that Nehemiah is a man of prayer saturated in Scripture, that his inspiring call, "Come, let us build the wall!," results in the people strengthening "their hands for the good work" (Neh. 2:17&#x2013;18). I love the way he labors with sword and trowel, not stopping for a change of clothes (4:17&#x2013;23); the way he stands fast against Sanballat and Tobiah; and the way he so clearly loves God and God's purposes more than his own life.&nbsp;<b>Your commentary is titled&nbsp;<i>Exalting Jesus in Ezra and Nehemiah</i>. How would you sum up the way Jesus shines forth from these two Old Testament narratives?</b>&nbsp;Here I'd draw attention to the way that Jesus is the issue below the surface even when he isn't the issue on the surface. Two examples, one from each book:&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people are intermarrying with idolaters in Ezra 9, Ezra says in 9:2 "the holy race [lit.&nbsp;<i>seed</i>]&nbsp;has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands." The preservation of the purity of the&nbsp;<i>seed</i>&nbsp;matters because the Messiah matters. These people have kept genealogies to trace the line of descent from the couple who heard God's words about the seed of the woman who would bruise the serpent's head way back in Genesis&nbsp;3:15. That line has come down through Abraham, Judah, and David, and if the people intermarry with idolaters the line of descent is endangered. If the line of descent fails, the Messiah will not come, the world will not be saved, and there will never be Christmas. Even though the book of Ezra doesn't spell everything out, we can connect the dots: he is passionate about the purity of Israel because he knows the world's desperate need for Israel's Messiah to accomplish redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same dynamic is at work in Nehemiah's concern for the building of the wall. Nehemiah cares about the wall because the wall will protect the people. Nehemiah cares about the people because God loves them, because God redeemed them, covenanted with them, and promised to raise up the one who would crush the oppressor for them. If there's no wall, the people will be oppressed, which could lead to them being dispersed, either because they all flee or because they get carried off captive. But if there is a wall, they have protection from enemies without and can enforce the law within. And if they can stand against enemies and live in accordance with Torah, they can preserve the line of descent that flows down from David to Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mystery of God's providence, we have the efforts of Ezra and Nehemiah to thank for our Savior's birth, life, death, and resurrection. God saved us through Jesus, and we see God's sovereignty in tension with human responsibility as we consider how Ezra and Nehemiah worked to ensure that there would be a Joseph and a Mary so there could be a Jesus. They didn't know that would be his name, but it was concern for him, hope for him, that drew Ezra and Nehemiah back to the Scriptures, kept them on their knees, compelled them to call the people to repent, and caused them to seek the rebuilding of people and wall.<br><b>We're looking forward to TGCW14, our women's conference, in which the plenary sessions will take us right through the book of Nehemiah with expositional teaching. What words would you have for both teachers and listeners as we all prepare?</b><br>Imitate Ezra and Nehemiah! Both men had a deep and rich understanding of earlier Scripture, of the Bible's big story and their place in it. Both men understood their role in the story. Both were men of prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Few things better prepare us for hearing the Bible taught than reading and re-reading the passages that will be exposited. And what could help our study of God's Word more than asking the Lord himself to open our eyes to see wonderful things in his law?&nbsp;<br>Read the Bible. Pray for God's help.

Thompson that spawned "gonzo journalism." Illustrated throughout in color and black-and-white, with an introduction by Hunter S. Thompson.<br></p><p>Hunter S. Thompson, in his drunken, rambling introduction to this volume of paintings and illustrations, calls Ralph Steadman "the Albert Gore of twentieth century art." It's hard to imagine a less apt appellation: Steadman's drawings and paintings are the wild antithesis of the notoriously stiff V.P. His pop art is also the opposite of Warhol's clean lines and soulless imagery; it screams with pain and nightmare power. While Steadman is best known for his illustrations to Thompson's <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> and other works, here his art is given free rein, and works with titles like "Earliest man, full of the sense of his own worth, screaming into the blackness, needing no god but himself..." and "Good time crucifix" combine Steadman's trademark splattered ink and unfolded figures with collage and sloppy airbrush. Although the text may offend those with no sense of irony (Thompson compares Steadman to artist manqu� Adolf Hitler; Steadman relates the story of his first bowel movement), the hyperactive visuals are sure to delight even those who've never snorted ether while tripping on pure human adrenochrome. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i>RALPH STEADMAN has illustrated many books, including Hunter S.

Self-contained and vibrant, it has its own restaurants, schools, theaters, churches, and night clubs. There are shotgun shacks and poverty, along with well-maintained houses like the one Loraylee Hawkins shares with her young son, Hawk, her Uncle Ray, and her grandmother, Bibi.

The government promises to provide new housing and relocate businesses. But locals like Pastor Ebenezer Polk, who&#x2019;s facing the demolition of his church, know the value of Brooklyn does not lie in bricks and mortar. Generations have lived, loved, and died here, supporting and strengthening each other. Yet street by street, longtime residents are being forced out.

One day we are healthy, comfortable, and happy. The next we find ourselves ill or injured, struggling, and distraught. The pain that invades our lives may come from our own suffering or that of a loved one. But no matter the source, we didn&#x2019;t see it coming.

He lives in Indianapolis, where he is active in neighborhood development.</p>Traditionally, many Christian denominations have held fast to the belief that those who confess God's saving grace from sin will be rewarded with eternal life while those who reject this grace will be damned to eternal perdition. Such a belief, according to ministers Gulley and Mulholland, fails miserably to acknowledge the real message of Christianity: that God's gracious arms are wide enough to hold every person, regardless of shortcomings or sins. The authors did notalways feel this way, and their little meditation on Christian universalism is as much autobiographical confession as theological treatise. Using stories from their own lives and ministries, Gulley and Mulholland devote a chapter to each of the words in the sentence "why God will save every person." In a seamless voice, they tell of people's struggles to accept teachings of the church that keep them from closeness with God. They also recall events in their own lives where they stood in the way of God's grace operating in personal relationships. For example, when one of their ministerial friends declared his homosexuality, they realized that - despite their former judgmental stance on homosexuality - this person deserved God's love and grace as much as any other. Salvation, they argue, is simply being freed of every obstacle to intimacy with God. Gulley and Mulholland's stirring manifesto on the central role of universalism in Christianity will provoke traditionalists and encourage new ways of thinking about the nature and purpose of the Christian faith. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Plants: 2400 Copyright-Free Illustrations of Flowers, Trees, Fruits and Vegetables</h2><p>This extraordinary collection of engravings provides designers and commercial artists with a magnificent sourcebook of Victorian-era plant images &#x2014; all royalty-free.

In addition to our own suffering, we also encounter the suffering of those around us. While the world of medicine attempts to relieve suffering and the media tries to sell us on a life without pain, only the Church offers the perspective that suffering has meaning. St. John Paul II&nbsp; said that suffering without meaning can lead to despair, but if we can attach meaning to our suffering, we are capable of going through anything. <i>When You Suffer</i> is a refreshing look at the mystery of pain and suffering and how to find meaning and even joy in the midst of it. Jeff Cavins discusses why we suffer and how our suffering can draw us closer to God. He explains that suffering is the greatest opportunity to love as Christ loves and how, by &#x201c;offering up&#x201d; our suffering, we join in Christ&#x2019;s mission to redeem the world.</p><p>Jeff Cavins, director of evangelization for the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, is the creator of the popular Great Adventure Bible Study series and the founding host of EWTN&#x2019;s weekly program<i> Life on the Rock</i>. He is an international speaker and the author of several books, including <i>Praise God and Thank Him: Biblical Keys for a Joyful Life</i>. He and his wife, Emily, lead annual pilgrimages to the Holy Land. The Cavinses live in Maple Grove, Minnesota.&#x201c;Jeff has a remarkable gift for helping people understand their faith in clear, understandable ways. This may be his most important work yet as he turns his attention to a topic that keeps so many people from knowing God and his peace.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Patrick Lencioni</b>, author, <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</i><br><br> &#x201c;Through engaging stories and winsome humor, Jeff Cavins communicates sound biblical advice for understanding suffering and its purposes. Drawing also on the wisdom of the saints&#x2014;from Augustine to John Paul II&#x2014;his book offers much-needed hope to readers and invites them to &#x2018;offer it up&#x2019; in union with Christ.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Rev. Pablo T. Gadenz</b>, associate professor of biblical studies, Seton Hall University<br><br> &#x201c;Anyone committed to the New Evangelization will discover in When You Suffer a practical and profound resource that embodies Pope Francis&#x2019;s vision of the Church as a &#x201c;field hospital&#x201d; for the suffering and lost. Cavins&#x2019;s intelligence, honesty, and humor shine a hopeful light on a heavy and difficult obstacle to faith for many people.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Rev. Michael White</b><br><br> &#x201c;Suffering is not something we can avoid in this life. But it is some- thing God can use for our good&#x2014;if we let him. In this engaging book, Jeff Cavins beautifully shows us how to experience God&#x2019;s comfort, guidance, and strength in moments of suffering. Whether it be in the little inconveniences and frustrations we face every day or when our lives are completely turned upside down, Jesus wants to meet us in the crosses we face and help us find new light, especially when we fear all has become dark.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Edward Sri</b>, author, <i>Men, Women and the Mystery of Love</i><br><br> &#x201c;We have a pressing need in our Church today for a theology of suffering, and Jeff Cavins has responded to this need. In When You Suffer, Cavins presents a compelling synthesis from Scripture and Tradition that is not just necessary but incredibly useful. I can think immediately of ten people to whom I&#x2019;d give a copy of this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Fr. James Mallon</b>, host of EWTN&#x2019;s Cross Training<br><br> &#x201c;Cavins takes on a perennial enigma of the human experience with much scriptural insight and spiritual wisdom. The words of St. Gianna Molla capture the heart of the message, &#x2018;One cannot love without suffering or suffer without loving.&#x2019; And his suggestions for &#x2018;offering it up&#x2019; are particularly compelling.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Bishop Michael Byrnes</b>, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit<br><br> &#x201c;When You Suffer helps the reader to approach suffering in a realistic and honest manner. In a confused and impatient world, this book is a welcome remedy. It&#x2019;s not just about suffering, it&#x2019;s about the way we live and understand living. Jeff Cavins has given us a tool that is relevant, smart, and personable.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Fr. Randy Dollins</b>, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Denver<br><br> &#x201c;Jeff Cavins has written an excellent book which sheds the profound light of the Scripture on that most universal of human realities, suffering. Read this yourself and give to your friends. This book will help tears turn into joy.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Ralph Martin</b><br><br> &#x201c;Jeff Cavins has written a solid, practical, book of biblical wisdom about handling the big and little suffering that come our way as Christians. Besides Scripture, he draws on the Catechism and the writings of the saints, especially St. John Paul II. It&#x2019;s easy to read, covers the territory, and is not too long. I plan on consulting it the next time suffering crosses my path!&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Dr. Peter S. Williamson</b>, professor of sacred Scripture, Sacred Heart Major Seminary<br><br> &#x201c;Suffering can be destructive or redemptive. Jesus forever defeats destructive suffering through the mystery of his cross and resurrec- tion.

When Grandma Lena is ready to pick her gargantuan vegetable, it will not budge. One by one, she enlists the help of her relatives, but it is only when Baby Pearl pitches in that the turnip is harvested, and then lovingly made into a soul-food feast for the neighborhood. Urbanovic's humorous watercolors are highlighted with charcoal detailing. The characters are delightful and each one has a great deal of individual expression and personality. Background details give a strong sense of setting. The illustrations of the growing vegetable take on outlandish proportions that readers will find funny and satisfying. The artist's use of perspective further enhances this rollicking story. Well written, charmingly illustrated, and with a new ethnic twist, this book is a first choice for libraries and an essential addition to collections of folktale variations. A great read-aloud, it also makes a natural introduction to units on seeds and growing, or gardening. Also, don't overlook the opportunities to discuss themes of cooperation, generosity, and community.&#x2013;<i>Mary Hazelton, Elementary Schools in Warren &amp; Waldoboro, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a toddler, he would stand on the counter of a local store in rural East Texas and recite verses for a stick of candy, continuing until his pockets couldn't hold another piece.</p> <p>Attending schools in small Texas towns like Daingerfield, Black Jack, and Pittsburg, he studied Greek, Latin, history, and English and developed persuasive skills and an apparent flair for leadership. At 13, he shared with some other boys the story of William Tell, the legendary marksman who shot an apple off his son's head with a bow and arrow. Admiring Tell's skill and bravery, but lacking the arrows, Morris and his friends decided to reenact the deed--with a gun.</p> <p>"We are told," reported the Pittsburg Press in 1888, "that several boys stood with apples on their heads and Morris with a target rifle shot them off--that is to say, the apples, fortunately not their heads."</p> <p>The boys' parents were horrified when they heard about the game and put a quick end to it. Morris escaped a whipping but got a stern lecture from his father, a local judge.</p> <p>When Morris finished his regular schooling at 16, he moved on to the University of Texas in Austin. Jumping into student life at the young and still-small school, he joined a fraternity, led a literary society, played the cornet and piano, and sang in the glee club. Always fond of a good joke, he got a kick out of entering the dining hall by walking on his hands. But he was best known for his preacherlike speaking skills and was selected to compete in contests and serve as a graduation speaker.</p> <p>From there he went to law school, spending two years in Austin and a third at Yale University in Connecticut. Once again, he attracted attention as a star orator, winning a debating prize and speaking at the graduation ceremonies.</p> <p>Somewhere between his general-store recitations and his law degree, young Morris came to a heartfelt belief: He despised liquor and the saloons that sold it. He sometimes said his feelings grew out of his grammar school science classes, where he saw vivid drawings of a drunkard's stomach and read about how alcohol destroyed the human body.</p> <p>He may have been influenced by the anti-liquor stance of the Methodist church, which he joined as a college student. His time at Yale also may have hardened his stance. He arrived there in debt and driven to succeed. So, he said, "I cut out every item of expense that was possible and quit every practice which might be injurious"--including tobacco, coffee, and tea. The result, he said, was "so satisfactory" that those items "remained on the contraband list ever since."</p> <p>After Yale, young Morris began practicing law in East Texas, but in 1902, his career took an unexpected turn. His father, John, who had been elected to a second term in the U.S. House of Representatives, fell ill and then passed away. Friends immediately urged Morris to run for his father's seat.</p> <p>By the mid-1920s, when he posed with two youngsters in front of the Capitol, Sheppard was a senior statesman in Congress.</p> <p>Jumping in just ten days before the primary election, Morris stumped the district, delivering an average of seven speeches a day. When his opponents made fun of his youth, he replied that it was something he "was overcoming day by day."</p> <p>To nearly everyone's surprise, he won the seat. At the age of twenty-seven, he headed to Washington.</p> <p>Small in stature at 5 feet, 7 inches, slight at 135 pounds, and youthful looking, Sheppard hardly looked like a Congressman. "It will take the older members some time to get to know Mr. Sheppard, so that they will not try to send him on errands," the Washington Post noted.</p> <p>While most known for his glittery speeches, Sheppard (center, seated) also chaired a U.S. House Public Buildings and Grounds Committee in 1912.</p> <p>Nicknamed the "boy orator of Texas," Sheppard was originally known more for his speaking skills than for any special legislation. As the "boy" matured into a confident congressman, the world outside of Washington was changing. Debates that had simmered for years over whether alcohol was dangerous and should be legally banned were beginning to roll to a boil. Originally, the arguments took place community by community and county by county. But as the number of towns outlawing liquor sales and saloons multiplied, the organizers raised the ante, taking aim at entire states. To support their efforts, Sheppard introduced legislation to keep liquor from moving from wet areas--where liquor was legal--into dry ones, where liquor was outlawed.</p> <p>In 1911, he actively campaigned to prohibit the sale of alcohol throughout Texas, openly supporting prohibition for the first time. Despite his efforts, the prohibition proposal fell a few thousand votes short in the hotly contested election.</p> <p>In 1913, one of Texas's U.S. senators resigned. Sheppard outmaneuvered a more popular candidate, and the Texas legislature selected him to fill the powerful job as senator. In a colorful speech to the state legislature, he accepted his new job, calling for limits on working hours, clearer and simpler laws, and, with fiery eloquence, an end to liquor sales.</p> <p>"The liquor traffic is a peril to society," he said. "I shall oppose this scourge from hell until my arm can strike no longer and my tongue can speak no more.</p> <p>"I shall oppose it because I hear the cries of children who are hungering for bread. I shall oppose it because I see a mother's wasted face, her pale lips pleading with the besotted figure at her side.</p> <p>"I shall oppose it because I see the staggering forms of men whose trembling hands hold but the ashes of their strength and pride.</p> <p>He concluded, "I shall oppose it because its abolition will mean a new stability for the Republic, a new radiance for the flag."</p> <p>Just months later, toward the end of 1913, the two biggest anti-liquor groups in the nation decided the time was right for an even more dramatic move. To end the scourge of alcohol now and for future generations, they proposed a national solution--not just a law, but an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would forever ban the sale of liquor throughout the country. To champion their cause in the U.S. Senate, they turned to Morris Sheppard.</p> <p>On a chilly winter day in December 1913, some 4,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., to take crucial steps toward changing America's drinking habits once and for all. Leading the march were children.</p> <p>Sheppard was elected to the Senate in 1913.</p> <p>At the very front, a young boy carried an American flag. Just behind him, dozens of girls in white dresses carried banners calling for a national prohibition on alcohol. Following them were Woman's Christian Temperance Union members from every state, many wearing the white ribbons that symbolized prohibition. Some sang their anthem, "A Saloonless Nation by 1920."</p> <p>Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Anti-Saloon League members march toward the Capitol in 1913 to present a proposed prohibition amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p> <p>Joining from another direction were the men of the Anti-Saloon League. Together, they marched to the Capitol. Waiting on the steps to receive a proposed constitutional amendment were Senator Sheppard and Representative Richmond Pearson Hobson of Alabama.</p> <p>Later that day, Sheppard introduced this constitutional amendment in Congress for the first time, saying, "The fact that alcohol undermines the brain and paralyzes the will of man, planting in him and his posterity the seeds of physical and moral degeneracy, the seeds of disease, the seeds of poverty, the seeds of crime, makes it a peril to the very existence of free government. Let the people of this Nation insert in the National Constitution, the source of the Nation's life, a clause prohibiting an evil that will prove to be the source of the nation's death."</p> <p>Results might take years. But with patience and determination, Sheppard and his supporters could--and would--change the culture, the behavior, and the course of America.</p> <p>For his role, Morris Sheppard would be known as the Father of National Prohibition. It would turn out to be a most dubious distinction.</p> <p>A playbill highlights the sobering message of Ten Nights in a Bar Room, a popular, long-running temperance play.</p> <p>BOOTLEG Text copyright � 2011 by Karen Blumenthal</p></p><h2>The Angel Tarot: Includes a full deck of 78 specially commissioned tarot cards and a 64-page illustrated book</h2><p>Connect with your angels via the ancient art of tarot with this beautiful box set of 78 cards and an accompanying guidebook.<br><br><b>Connect with your angels via the ancient art of tarot with this beautiful box set of 78 cards and an accompanying guidebook.</b><br> <br>International clairvoyant Jayne Wallace presents her first Angel Tarot&#x2014;a full deck of 78 angel-inspired cards that bring you daily messages and predictions from the angelic realm.

It is called by many names, and lived in a variety of ways by different couples. The most common terms used to describe it are &#39;hotwife&#39; or &#39;cuckold lifestyle.&#39; This sexual practice, a form of sexual nonmonogamy, is distinguished from swinging and polyamory in that the husband rarely seeks sexual contact outside the marriage except for participation in group sex with his wife and other men, while the wife is permitted and often encouraged to pursue unrestrained sexual encounters with other men. The author includes interviews and comments from couples living the lifestyle throughout the U.S., and presents the stories in an attempt to determine the history of this sexual practice and its role in society and in relationships. He explores the psychological, social, biological, and evolutionary underpinnings of this uncommon and socially taboo behavior in an effort to make it more comprehensible to those engaged in the lifestyle and those who are just curious.</p><p>I wrote this book in order to better understand the marriages and sexual practices of a unique group of people who choose to engage in sexual behaviors that most societies have condemned and labeled as taboo. Along the way, I learned a tremendous amount about female and male sexuality, and about the integral ingredients of healthy marriages. This book is not about my own sexuality, any more than it is about the sexuality of all men and women, and all husbands and wives. Whether you are interested in this lifestyle or not, this book will change the way you look at sexuality within (and without) a marriage."What is most compelling is not the sexual titillation, found aplenty in this book, but being taken along on Dr. Ley's clinical journey, exploring controversial aspects of sexuality."--Carole Lieberman, M.D., M.P.H., Psychiatrist and Bestselling Author of Bad Boys: Why We Love Them, How to Live with Them, and When to Leave Them <p>"Consensual Nonmonogamy is bursting out of the closet, gaining wider attention from therapists, researchers and the larger public. One particular kind of nonmonogamy, the hotwife/cuckold dynamic, shows how some people express and explore their sexuality by taking a less-trodden path. This book serves as a great introduction - not just in providing some important basic information and a meaningful context, but by emotionally accompanying the reader who might be taking their first intellectual steps in understanding the hotwife / cuckold dynamic or understanding consensual nonmonogamous sexuality in successful long-term relationships."--Richard A. Sprott, Ph.D., Executive Director of CARAS (Community-Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities) </p><p>"Ley has written a valuable and important book. Regardless of what your values and preferences may be, this book is thoroughly engrossing and impressive in its thoughtful, disciplined, informative approach. Western culture and psychological theories have led us to think that no man will tolerate his wife having sex with other men, but this book shows that in fact such practices have existed across cultural and historical boundaries. Some men not only tolerate but positively enjoy the amorous adventures of their wives. The mixture of history and science, anecdote, and interview makes this a truly remarkable book. Anyone interested in the range and breadth of human sexual activity, whether from personal curiosity or professional interest, will find this well-written and carefully researched book to be enlightening and entertaining."--Roy F.

Why do we commit these chess-board sins? Are they the result of general misconceptions about chess and how it should be played? And how can we recognize the warning signs better?<br> <br> In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, Jonathan Rowson investigates, in his inimitable style, the main reasons why chess-players sometimes go horribly astray, focusing on the underlying psychological pitfalls:<br> * Thinking (unnecessary or erroneous)<br> * Blinking (missing opportunities; lack of resolution)<br> * Wanting (too much concern with the result of the game)<br> * Materialism (lack of attention to non-material factors)<br> * Egoism (insufficient awareness of the opponent and his ideas)<br> * Perfectionism (running short of time; trying too hard)<br> * Looseness (&#x201c;losing the plot&#x201d;; drifting; poor concentration)<br> <br></p><p><br> <b>Jonathan Rowson</b> became Scotland&#x2019;s third grandmaster in late 1999, within months of graduating from Oxford University.

Simultaneous.</p><p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;Following the daytime and nighttime activities of a variety of animals through the calendar year, this work explores a number of concepts for young learners. Each spread shows the possible happenings in the life of an animal during the day and of different creature at night. In January, eagles are paired with wolves, while the warmer month of June finds bees and bats hunting for food. Dark-tone watercolor illustrations are accompanied by simple rhymes that border on doggerel but will engage early readers. Food gathering, winter color change, and egg laying are among the activities shown. In an "Explore More" section, a match game is offered to reinforce the information previously presented. Additional details are provided about each animal as well as suggestions for "Teachable Moment" activities, which may be used by educators or parents. Some of the projects suggested are looking for slugs and snails after dark, and identifying the different seasons in the illustrations. VERDICT As an easy introduction to a variety of nocturnal and diurnal animals, this book will appeal to budding naturalists. A good choice for large nonfiction collections.&#x2014;Eva Elisabeth VonAncken, formerly at Trinity-Pawling School, Pawling, NY</p><h2>Everything You Know Is STILL Wrong: Revised Edition</h2><p>"Everything You Know Is STILL Wrong" updates and expands on Lloyd Pye's ground-breaking theories. He explains how everything from our understanding of the formation of planet Earth to macroevolution is based on theories that only tell part of the story and may not be entirely accurate. Central to the book is "Intervention Theory", the controversial but surprisingly fact-based idea that aliens intervened in Earth's early history to build life as we know it. Twenty years after the original "Everything You Know Is Wrong" was published (in 1997), science has dramatically advanced our knowledge and understanding. Yet much of what we think we all know is actually nothing more than theories based on flawed assumptions that can actually be proved wrong... And that proof is referenced in the pages of "Everything You Know Is STILL Wrong". Lloyd Pye sadly passed away in 2013, but the copious notes and drafts that he left behind have been diligently pieced together and supplemented with new discoveries and up-to-date facts. Although this book is intended to be an updated version of the original, this new edition truly stands alone as an almost completely new work.

Rosemond lays out a perfectly sound and logical case for recognizing the realities of the teen-parent relationship, forming the foundation, and parenting with the "Long Rope Principle." In short, the author demonstrates how Mom and Dad can avoid the pitfalls of becoming dictatorial "Control Freaks," skirt the potholes of turning into permissive "Wimps," and enjoy the freedom and rewards of parenting in a controlled (but not controlling) and relaxed manner. Teenagers, Rosemond readily admits, can be a challenge. But infusing young adults with a sense of personal responsibility, then showing them the results of good and bad choices, is a goal every parent can achieve.</p><p>Parents can protect toddlers--with their maximum mobility and minimum logic--by pasting plastic on electrical outlets and putting poisons out of reach. But protecting teenagers is not so simple, says family psychologist and author of <i>Raising a Nonviolent Child</i> John Rosemond. "Short of solitary confinement, you can't guarantee that a teen won't use drugs, shoplift, drink or crash the car. In the final analysis, teens must protect themselves." Rosemond's <i>Teen-Proofing</i> provides parents with tough-love strategies for managing teens so they make self-protective, rather than self-destructive, decisions.<p> Many parents will recognize the error of their ways in Rosemond's portraits of parents as "micro-managers" who try to control their children and "wimps" who let their children control them. He offers a compelling alternative by urging parents to be "mentors, who realize they can control the parent-child relationship, but not the child." The author explores critical parent-teen issues including curfews, cash, cars, and cohorts--detailing an approach that gives teenagers a "long rope" to make their own mistakes and also offers "creative consequences" to encourage responsible decision making.</p><p> The author offers smart and seasoned advice--from coping with middle school "tweenagers" to understanding why teens are vulnerable and how the culture diminishes a parent's influence. Yet he undermines his clarity with snide asides about mental health professionals and one too many smug and self-congratulatory examples of his own parenting of a son and daughter. These distractions are unnecessary; the book's unconventional and provocative suggestions will speak volumes to parents of teens. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>John Rosemond is a family psychologist who has directed mental-health programs and been in full-time private practice working with families and children. Since 1990, he has devoted his time to speaking and writing.

They were often mentioned alongside phrases like &#34;last resort,&#34; &#34;out of money,&#34; and &#34;bad choice.&#34; In 2014, intrigued by the seemingly universal bad rap reverse mortgages had cultivated, Dr. Wade Pfau began researching them in depth. Over the course of the next year, he came to the conclusion that reverse mortgages aren&#39;t inherently a bad idea, though they are often misunderstood and not used in a most beneficial way. In fact, Dr. Pfau realized that reverse mortgages---when used correctly---can provide an added layer of security for retirees and allow them to enjoy retirement more by gaining liquidity from an illiquid asset. This second edition of the book is fully revised and updated for the modification of reverse mortgage rules affecting applications after October 2, 2017.</p><p>Wade D. Pfau, Ph.D., CFA, is a Professor of Retirement Income in the Ph.D. program for Financial and Retirement Planning at The American College in Bryn Mawr, PA. He also serves as a Principal and Director for McLean Asset Management and Chief Planning Strategist of software provider inStream Solutions. He holds a doctorate in economics from Princeton University and publishes frequently in a wide variety of academic and practitioner research journals on topics related to retirement income. He hosts the Retirement Researcher website, and is a contributor to Forbes, Advisor Perspectives, Journal of Financial Planning, and an Expert Panelist for the Wall Street Journal. His research has been discussed in outlets including the print editions of The Economist, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Time, Kiplinger&#x2019;s, and Money Magazine. He is the author of the books, How Much Can I Spend in Retirement? A Guide to Investment-Based Retirement Income Strategies, and Reverse Mortgages: How to Use Reverse Mortgages to Secure Your Retirement.A researcher and financial analyst explains the role of the reverse mortgage in retirement planning.<br><br>In this debut finance book, Pfau draws on accumulated research and a deep understanding of the intricacies of reverse mortgages to advocate for their role in a balanced fiscal strategy for retirement. The book covers the basics of retirement finance, explaining the common investment vehicles employed to provide funds for an individual no longer drawing a salary, and then focuses on the mechanics of using a reverse mortgage as one component of the income stream. Pfau explains the regulations governing reverse mortgages, from penalties designed to prevent a homeowner from making unwise decisions when converting the dwelling's value to cash to the protections in place that ensure a nonborrowing spouse can continue to live in the house as needed. The book takes a calm and moderate approach to fiscal planning for retirement, offering numerous examples of the actual returns a homeowner can achieve in comparison to other investment vehicles and avoiding an alarmist tone regarding the viability of job departure or the future of finance. The result is both informative and well-reasoned, providing substantial information about reverse mortgages while emphasizing the fact that they are one component of responsible financial planning and not a panacea in themselves:"coordinating withdrawals from a reverse mortgage reduces strain on portfolio withdrawals, which helps manage sequence of returns risk." Pfau acknowledges that although a house represents a significant fiscal asset, it also plays an emotional role in its owners' lives that must be addressed in planning for its eventual disposal. He clearly explains that the reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners to remain in a place they love while still benefiting from the equity stored in it, can be a practical solution that addresses both monetary and personal criteria. "Further Reading" sections at the end of each chapter provide additional information for readers in search of more details about both the research cited and the workings of the financial instrument.A well-reasoned argument in favor of the reverse mortgage as a component of a retirement strategy.<br><br><i><b>-Kirkus Reviews</b></i><br><br>Reverse mortgage get bad press.

An older couple who thought they were retiring to a quiet seaside town got too deeply involved with local politics and the Dixie Mafia and were murdered. The investigation would've sunk beneath the muddy swirl of graft and business as usual but for the tenacious efforts of the victims' daughter. Despite death threats and indifferent law enforcement officials, she hired a private detective and swore to do whatever it took to bring her parents' killers to trial. Horror/suspense writer Peter Straubfinds the story reminiscent of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen: "Like those writers, Edward Humes can make the wild, amoral, scheming sleazoids he parades before our eyes all but sing and dance on the page.

In the Calvinos, Dean Koontz brings to life a family that might be your own, in a war for their survival against an adversary more malevolent than any he has yet created, with their own home the battleground. Of all his acclaimed novels, none exceeds <em>What the Night Knows</em> in power, in chilling suspense, and in sheer mesmerizing storytelling. <br><br><strong>A Letter from Author Dean Koontz</strong> <br> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Villains and Vegetables</strong><br> Readers ask certain questions over and over again. Such as, "How often have you been institutionalized?" and "How does your wife sleep at night, knowing what kind of stories spring from your mind?" and "If you could be any kind of vegetable, what vegetable would you be?"<p></p> <p>Because I found most schoolwork tedious, I felt as if I had been institutionalized for fifteen years--throughout grade school, high school, and college. In the grim institution called high school, as a kid in a small town, my therapy consisted of reading novels and listening to rock-and-roll on tower-of-power radio stations in distant cities. In college, my therapy was all-night pinochle tournaments. I cut more classes than Sweeney Todd cut throats.</p> <p>My wife sleeps peacefully, thank you. She knows I'm basically a pussycat. We have been together since high school, and in all those years, the only living thing she has seen me cut is myself; any time I pick up the simplest tool or kitchen implement to do some minor household task, my blood will inevitably flow. I've been known to cut myself accidentally with something as seemingly safe as a rolling pin.</p> <p>Sugar snap peas.</p> <p>Another frequently asked question is "How do you create such bizarre yet convincing and terrifying villains." The glib answer is to say I watch the evening news. In fact, however, the antagonists in my novels create themselves, just as do the protagonists. I conceive a character around a seed of truth, some essential fact that lies at the core of him, then I give him free will, and I discover more about him as the story unfolds. Sometimes, when characters surprise me with their revelations, it seems as if they are indeed real, that I am writing in a kind of dream state that allows me to bridge this world with some parallel reality and tap the consciousness of people living</p> <p>Alton Turner Blackwood, the villain of <em>Darkness Under the Sun</em> and of the forthcoming novel <em>What the Night Knows</em>, literally appeared to me in one of those exceedingly vivid dreams that are peculiar to many of us who, suffering allergies, take two or three Benedryl every night for too many weeks. Benedryl dreams are, in my experience, never flat-out nightmares. They generally do not have much in the way of storylines, but the people in them are so dimensional and so exquisitely detailed that they seem as real as anyone you would meet in real life. They are sometimes strange, as well, and menacing, though these are for the most part dreams without action, so their menace is implied.</p> <p>The morning after the Benedryl dream in which Alton Turner Blackwood appeared (though he had no name in the dream), I wrote down a physical description of him, which I used word for word in the finished novel:</p> <p><em>He stood six feet five, scarecrow-thin but strong. His hands were immense, the spatulate fingers as suctorial as the toe discs of a web-foot toad, large bony wrists like robot joints, orangutan-long arms. His shoulder blades were thick and malformed, so that bat wings appeared to be furled under his shirt.</em></p> <p>As for how his face looks and as for the explanation of how and why such a specimen might be born: I'll let you discover those things in the novella and the novel.</p> <p>Of the scores of evil characters I have created, none has so affected me as Alton Turner Blackwood. In spite of all his physical and mental strangenesses, I would not be surprised to see him one evening, walking along a lonely highway or perhaps standing under a lamppost across the street, still and watchful. Of all the eerie characters met in Benedryl dreams--many of them like people you might expect to see in Tim Burton movies--he is the only one who has made a second appearance in my sleep. And he's appeared three times. I don't know what to make of that. If his repeated appearance means anything, I guess I'll find out eventually.</p> <p>Baby carrots are also cool.</p> <p></p><b>A Letter from Author Dean Koontz</b> <br> <p></p> <b>Let's Call It "The Turn of the Phillips-Head Screw"</b><br> I was happily working on a novel titled <i>What the Night Knows</i>, the premise of which was already described on various web-site postings, when an idea for a ghost story slammed into me with as much force as an exuberant 60-pound golden retriever playing bowl-dad-off-his-feet. When I picked myself up from my office floor, I didn't need a sticky roller to remove the dog hair from my clothes, but the story I had been working on was entirely Swiffered out of my head to make room for the ghost story. After alerting my editor and my publisher of my intentions, I put aside <i>What the Night Knows</i> and set to work enthusiastically on the new idea. <p></p> Over the next few months, as the manuscript pages piled up, I occasionally sent lists of possible titles to my editor and my publisher, and they sent lists of titles to me. None of us liked the same title. We didn't argue. We just quietly declined to be enthusiastic about one another's suggestions. We are a genteel bunch. The only one of us to wake with the severed head of a horse in his bed was me, and that was unrelated to the disagreement about titles. I'm not even sure who sent the horse's head, although I did fail to renew my subscription to <i>Oprah</i> magazine, and their circulation department does play hardball. <p></p> Anyway, one day, when I was deep into the still untitled ghost story, I suddenly realized that the title of the novel I had set aside, <i>What the Night Knows</i>, would be a perfect title for the novel I was writing. In fact, it was more suited to the ghost story than to the novel to which it had been previously attached. I emailed my publisher suggesting that I steal this title from myself, and as I sent that email, I simultaneously received one from her--which made the same suggestion. This seemed like destiny at work, and if not destiny, then something even stranger, something with which a wise person would not screw around. <p></p> Now, the ghost story, <i>What the Night Knows</i>, is scheduled to land in bookstores on 28 December, and the book I set aside--but to which I will return--doesn't have a title. So here we go again. Sometimes I think that life is nothing but a never-ending series of problems and crises, a dark journey of frustration and anxiety and despair, and I really just want to hijack a gasoline tanker truck and drive it at high speed over a cliff. But then I eat a couple of Reese's peanut-butter cups, and everything's swell again. <p></p></p><h2>Mother of God Similar to Fire</h2><p>Fifty selected images by renowned icon-painter William Hart McNichols are illuminated by Mirabai Starr&#39;s lyrical prose-poems to help make the eternal figure of Mary vibrantly accessible.</p><p>William Hart McNichols, a priest and icon painter, lives in Taos, New Mexico.

Even worse, due to a common shelter policy, her dad must live in a men&#39;s shelter, separated from her and her mom. Despite these circumstances, the family still finds time to be together. They meet at the park to play hide-and-seek, slide on slides, and pet puppies. While the young girl wishes for better days when her family is together again under a roof of their very own, she continues to remind herself that they&#39;re still a family even in times of separation.</p><p><b>Brenda Reeves Sturgis</b> is an award-winning author of the picture books <i>10 Turkeys in the Road</i>, <i>The Lake Where Loon Lives</i>, and <i>Touchdown! </i>This is her fourth book.

She aspires to create interesting and educational picture books for children around the world. Jo-Shin lives in Taiwan.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Families are bound together by love, even when circumstances force them to live apart, affirms the young narrator of this story about a family struggling to rebuild their lives. The little girl matter-of-factly relates the challenges of being homeless, among them waiting in line at a soup kitchen, wearing too-small shoes, and not being able to live with both her parents. The biracial preschooler (her mother is brown-skinned, while her father has a light complexion) wishes her father didn't have to sleep separately at a shelter for men but knows that they are "still a family." The emphasis throughout is on the many ways the members of this family manage to find joy and comfort in one another, putting a human face on their plight. The family are portrayed with dignity and respect, as active agents rather than passive victims. In keeping with the first-person narration, Lee's illustrations evoke a child's crayon and watercolor drawings. Young readers who have not experienced homelessness will need an adult to help answer the many questions that arise, while those who have will find comfort in this gentle story. Pair with Lois Brandt's Maddi's Fridge and Matt de la Pe�a's Last Stop on Market Street.

This was addressed by The Negro Motorist Green Book, an annual listing of lodging, diners, gas stations, and other businesses that could handle the needs of the Black customer. Created in 1936 by Harlem-based postman Victor H. Green, the Green Book served the public until after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s ended legal segregation.</p><p>Original copies of the <em>Green Book</em> are now museum pieces, but in this book you can see all the articles, all the ads, and all the listings from four editions of the <em>Green Book</em>, one for each decade in which the series was published. <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em> of 1938 is an early example, covering only the states east of the Mississippi River, but also presenting articles on "The Automobile and What It Has Done for the American Negro" as well as driving tips. By 1947, the <em>Negro Motorist Green Book</em> had listings for 45 of the 48 states that then existed (there was nothing for Nevada, New Hampshire, or North Dakota), and that also included directories of the Negro colleges and newspapers of the day, as well as a look at the current models from Ford and GM, and some notes on automotive design of the future. By 1954, the title had changed to <em>The Negro Travelers' Green Book</em>, and the volume includes an article on the highlights of San Francisco (which was "fast becoming the focal point of the Negroes' future") and tourist guides to New York City and Bermdua. Finally, the <em>Travelers' Green Book</em> for 1963 through 1964 leads off with a state-by-state listings of rights against "jimcro" (Jim Crow segregation), plus it has "Guide Posts for a Pleasant Trip," a couple of cartoon-illustrated sidebars on Black history-makers, a listing of major league ballparks, and other useful items for the traveler.</p><p>Reprints of the <em>Green Book</em> published by About Comics have gotten coverage by <em>Newsweek</em>, the <em>Guardian</em>, and BBC News, and more. They are carried by major museums, and have been used by TV and film. Now you can get four editions in one convenient volume, and see why the <em>New York Times</em> called the Green Book a "beacon for Black travelers."</p></p><p>Victor Hugo Green (1892-1960) was a postman living in Harlem when he created The Negro Motorist Green Book, giving his fellow African-American travelers a guide that eased their way.

In the card that came with the voucher she wrote Make Some Time For Yourself, Samantha!!!<br><br> Which I did fully intend to do.

But I seriously have to be back in the office by one.<br><br> Maya looks up, a thoughtful expression on her face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re obviously quite a stressed-out woman.&#x201d;<br><br> What? Where does she get that from? I specifically put on the form, I am not stressed-out.<br><br> &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; I hope Maya&#x2019;s taking in my relaxed, see-how-unstressed-I-am smile. She looks unconvinced.<br><br> &#x201c;Your job is obviously very pressured.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thrive under pressure,&#x201d; I explain. Which is true. I&#x2019;ve known that about myself ever since . . .<br><br> Well. Ever since my mother told me, when I was about eight. You thrive under pressure, Samantha. Our whole family thrives under pressure. It&#x2019;s like our family motto or something.<br><br> Apart from my brother Peter, of course. He had a nervous breakdown. But the rest of us.<br><br> I love my job. I love spotting the loophole in a contract. I love the thrill of negotiation, and arguing my case, and making the sharpest point in the room. I love the adrenaline rush of closing a deal.<br><br> I suppose just occasionally I do feel as though someone&#x2019;s piling heavy weights on me. Like big concrete blocks, one on top of the other, and I have to keep holding them up, no matter how exhausted I am . . .<br><br> But then everyone probably feels like that. It&#x2019;s normal.<br><br> &#x201c;Your skin&#x2019;s very dehydrated.&#x201d; Maya is shaking her head. She runs an expert hand across my cheek and rests her fingers underneath my jaw, looking concerned. &#x201c;Your heart rate&#x2019;s very high. That&#x2019;s not healthy. Are you feeling particularly tense?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Work&#x2019;s pretty busy at the moment.&#x201d; I shrug. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a blip. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Can we get on with it?<br><br> &#x201c;Well.&#x201d; Maya gets up. She presses a button set in the wall and gentle pan-pipe music fills the air. &#x201c;All I can say is, you&#x2019;ve come to the right place, Samantha. Our aim here is to de-stress, revitalize, and detoxify.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; I say, only half listening. I&#x2019;ve just remembered that I never got back to David Elldridge about the Ukrainian oil contract. I meant to call him yesterday. Shit.<br><br> &#x201c;Our aim is to provide a haven of tranquility, away from all your day-to-day worries.&#x201d; Maya presses another button in the wall, and the light dims to a muted glow. &#x201c;Before we start,&#x201d; she says softly, &#x201c;do you have any questions?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually, I do.&#x201d; I lean forward.<br><br> &#x201c;Good!&#x201d; She beams. &#x201c;Are you curious about today&#x2019;s treatments, or is it something more general?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could I possibly send a quick e-mail?&#x201d;<br><br> Maya&#x2019;s smile freezes on her face.<br><br> &#x201c;Just quickly,&#x201d; I add. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take two secs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Samantha, Samantha . . .&#x201d; Maya shakes her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here to relax. To take a moment for yourself. Not to send e-mails. E-mail&#x2019;s an obsession! An addiction! As evil as alcohol. Or caffeine.&#x201d;<br><br> For goodness sake, I&#x2019;m not obsessed. I mean, that&#x2019;s ridiculous. I check my e-mails about once every . . . thirty seconds, maybe.<br><br> The thing is, a lot can change in thirty seconds.<br><br> &#x201c;And besides, Samantha,&#x201d; Maya goes on. &#x201c;Do you see a computer in this room?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I reply, obediently looking around the dim little room, at posters of yoga positions and a wind chime and a row of crystals arranged on the windowsill.<br><br> &#x201c;This is why we ask that you leave all electronic equipment in the safe. No mobile phones are permitted. No little computers.&#x201d; Maya spreads her arms. &#x201c;This is a retreat. An escape from the world.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; I nod meekly.<br><br> Now is probably not the time to reveal that I have a BlackBerry hidden in my paper knickers.<br><br> &#x201c;So, let&#x2019;s begin.&#x201d; Maya smiles. &#x201c;Lie down, please, under a towel. And remove your watch.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I need my watch!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Another addiction.&#x201d; She tsks reprovingly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to know the time while you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br><br> She turns away, and with reluctance I take off my watch. Then, a little awkwardly, I arrange myself on the massage table, trying to avoid squashing my precious BlackBerry.<br><br> I did see the rule about no electronic equipment. And I did surrender my Dictaphone. But three hours without a BlackBerry? I mean, what if something came up at the office? What if there was an emergency?<br><br> If they really wanted people to relax, they would let them keep their BlackBerrys and mobile phones, not confiscate them.<br><br> Anyway, she&#x2019;ll never see it under my towel.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to begin with a relaxing foot rub,&#x201d; says Maya, and I feel her smoothing some kind of lotion over my feet. &#x201c;Try to clear your mind.&#x201d;<br><br> I stare dutifully up at the ceiling. Clear mind. My mind is as clear as a transparent . . . glass . . .<br><br> What am I going to do about Elldridge? He&#x2019;ll be waiting for a response. What if he tells the other partners I was lax? What if it affects my chances of partnership?<br><br> I feel a clench of alarm. Now is not the time to leave anything to chance.<br><br> &#x201c;Try to let go of all your thoughts. . . .&#x201d; Maya is chanting. &#x201c;Feel the release of tension. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Maybe I could send him a very quick e-mail.<br><br> Surreptitiously I reach down and feel the hard corner of my BlackBerry. Gradually I inch it out of my paper knickers. Maya is still massaging my feet, totally oblivious.<br><br> &#x201c;Your body is growing heavy . . . your mind should be emptying . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I edge the BlackBerry up onto my chest until I can just see the screen underneath the towel. Thank goodness this room is so dim. Trying to keep my movements to a minimum, I furtively start typing an e-mail with one hand.<br><br> &#x201c;Relaax . . .&#x201d; Maya is saying in soothing tones. &#x201c;Imagine you&#x2019;re walking along a beach . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Uh-huh . . .&#x201d; I murmur.<br><br> David, I&#x2019;m typing. Re ZFN Oil contract. I read through amendments. Feel our response should be<br><br> &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; says Maya, suddenly alert.<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing!&#x201d; I say, hastily shoving the BlackBerry back under the towel. &#x201c;Just . . . er . . . relaxing.&#x201d;<br><br> Maya comes round the couch and looks at the bump in the towel where I&#x2019;m clutching the BlackBerry.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you hiding something?&#x201d; she says in disbelief.<br><br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br> From under the towel the BlackBerry emits a little bleep. Damn.<br><br> &#x201c;I think that was a car,&#x201d; I say, trying to sound casual. &#x201c;Outside in the street.&#x201d;<br><br> Maya&#x2019;s eyes narrow.<br><br> &#x201c;Samantha,&#x201d; she says ominously. &#x201c;Do you have a piece of electronic equipment under there?&#x201d;<br><br> I have the feeling that if I don&#x2019;t confess she&#x2019;ll rip my towel off anyway.<br><br> &#x201c;I was just sending an e-mail,&#x201d; I say at last, and sheepishly produce the BlackBerry.<br><br> &#x201c;You workaholics!&#x201d; She grabs it out of my hand in exasperation. &#x201c;E-mails can wait. It can all wait. You just don&#x2019;t know how to relax!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a workaholic!&#x201d; I retort indignantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a lawyer! It&#x2019;s different!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in denial.&#x201d; She shakes her head.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not! Look, we&#x2019;ve got some big deals on at the firm. I can&#x2019;t just switch off! Especially not right now. I&#x2019;m . . . well, I&#x2019;m up for partnership at the moment.&#x201d;<br><br> As I say the words aloud I feel the familiar stabbing of nerves. Partner of one of the biggest law firms in the country. The only thing I&#x2019;ve ever wanted, ever.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m up for partnership,&#x201d; I repeat, more calmly. &#x201c;They make the decision tomorrow. If it happens, I&#x2019;ll be the youngest partner in the history of the firm. Do you know how big a deal that is? Do you have any idea&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anyone can take a couple of hours out,&#x201d; interrupts Maya. She puts her hands on my shoulders. &#x201c;Samantha, you&#x2019;re incredibly nervy. Your shoulders are rigid, your heart&#x2019;s racing . . . it seems to me you&#x2019;re right on the edge.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a bundle of jitters!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You have to decide to slow down, Samantha.&#x201d; She looks at me earnestly. &#x201c;Only you can decide to change your life. Are you going to do that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Er . . . well . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I stop with a squeak of surprise, as from inside my paper knickers there comes a judder.<br><br> My mobile phone. I shoved it in there along with the BlackBerry and turned it onto vibrate so it wouldn&#x2019;t make a noise.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Maya is gaping at my twitching towel. &#x201c;What on earth is that . . . quivering?&#x201d;<br><br> I can&#x2019;t admit it&#x2019;s a phone. Not after the BlackBerry.<br><br> &#x201c;Erm . . .&#x201d; I clear my throat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my special . . . er . . . love toy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your what?&#x201d; Maya looks taken aback.<br><br> The phone judders inside my pants again. I have to answer. It might be the office.<br><br> &#x201c;Um . . . you know, I&#x2019;m reaching a bit of an intimate moment right now.&#x201d; I give Maya a significant look. &#x201c;Maybe you could . . . uh . . . leave the room?&#x201d;<br><br> Suspicion snaps into Maya&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br> &#x201c;Wait a moment!&#x201d; She peers again. &#x201c;Is that a phone under there? You smuggled in a mobile phone as well?&#x201d;<br><br> Oh, God. She looks furious.<br><br> &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I say, trying to sound apologetic. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve got your rules and everything, which I do respect, but the thing is, I need my mobile.&#x201d; I reach under the towel for the phone.<br><br> &#x201c;Leave it!&#x201d; Maya&#x2019;s cry takes me by surprise. &#x201c;Samantha,&#x201d; she says, making an obvious effort to keep calm. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve listened to a single word I&#x2019;ve said . . . you&#x2019;ll switch the phone off right now.&#x201d;<br><br> The phone vibrates again in my hand. I look at the caller ID and feel a twist in my stomach. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the office.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They can leave a message. They can wait.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;This is your own time.&#x201d; She leans forward and clasps my hands earnestly. &#x201c;Your own time.&#x201d;<br><br> She really doesn&#x2019;t get it, does she? I almost want to laugh.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an associate at Carter Spink,&#x201d; I explain. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have my own time.&#x201d; I flip the phone open and an angry male voice bites down the line.<br><br> &#x201c;Samantha, where the hell are you?&#x201d;<br><br> It&#x2019;s Ketterman. The head of our corporate department. He&#x2019;s in his late forties and his first name is John, but no one ever calls him anything except Ketterman. He has black hair and steel glasses and gray gimlet eyes, and when I first arrived at Carter Spink I actually used to have nightmares about him.<br><br> &#x201c;The Fallons deal is back on. Get back here now. Meeting at ten-thirty.&#x201d;<br><br> Back on?<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can.&#x201d; I snap the phone shut and look ruefully at Maya. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;<br> I&#x2019;m not addicted to my watch.<br><br> But obviously I rely on it. You would too, if your time was measured in six-minute segments. For every six minutes of my working life, I&#x2019;m supposed to bill a client. It all goes on a computerized time sheet, in itemized chunks.<br><br> 11:00&#x2013;11:06 drafted contract for Project A<br><br> 11:06&#x2013;11:12 amended documentation for Client B<br><br> 11:12&#x2013;11:18 consulted on point for Agreement C<br><br> When I first started at Carter Spink it freaked me out slightly, the idea that I had to write down what I was working on, every minute of the day. I used to think: What if I do nothing for six minutes? What am I supposed to write down then?<br><br> 11:00&#x2013;11:06 stared aimlessly out of window<br><br> 11:06&#x2013;11:12 daydreamed about bumping into George Clooney in street<br><br> 11:12&#x2013;11:18 attempted to touch nose with tongue<br><br> But if you&#x2019;re a lawyer at Carter Spink, you don&#x2019;t sit around. Not when every six minutes of your time is worth money. If I let six minutes of time tick away, I&#x2019;ve lost the firm �50. Twelve minutes, �100. Eighteen minutes, �150. And the truth is, you get used to measuring your life in little chunks. And you get used to working. All the time.<br><br> Two<br><br> As I arrive at the office, Ketterman is standing by my desk, looking with an expression of distaste at the mess of papers and files strewn everywhere.<br><br> Truthfully, I don&#x2019;t have the most pristine desk in the world. In fact . . . it&#x2019;s a bit of a shambles. But I am intending to tidy it up and sort out all the piles of old contracts on the floor. As soon as I have a moment.<br><br> &#x201c;Meeting in ten minutes,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I want the draft financing documentation ready.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; I reply. Ketterman is unnerving at the best of times. He just emanates scary, brainy power. But today is a million times worse, because Ketterman is on the decision panel. Tomorrow morning at nine a.m., he and thirteen other partners are holding a big meeting to decide on which ass...</p><h2>A Load of Hooey</h2><p><p>Bob Odenkirk is a legend in the comedy-writing world, winning Emmys and acclaim for his work on <i>Saturday Night Live, Mr. Show with Bob and David,</i> and many other seminal TV shows. This book, his first, is a spleen-bruisingly funny omnibus that ranges from absurdist monologues ( Martin Luther King, Jr&#x2019;s Worst Speech Ever&#x201d;) to intentionally bad theater ( Hitler Dinner Party: A Play&#x201d;); from avant-garde fiction ( Obituary for the Creator of Madlibs&#x201d;) to free-verse poetry that's funnier and more powerful than the work of Calvin Trillin, Jewel, and Robert Louis Stevenson combined.<br><br>Odenkirk's debut resembles nothing so much as a hilarious new sketch comedy show that&#x2019;s exclusively available as a streaming video for your mind.

He co-created and starred in <i>Mr. Show with Bob and David</i>, which ran on HBO and has been called the American Monty Python,&#x201d; which is perhaps a bit of an overstatement in his opinion. Bob has written short comic pieces for the <i>New Yorker</i> and had a regular page in <i>Vice</i> magazine - and there's not much overlap between those two publications, is there? <br><br>Bob has directed three feature films: <i>Melvin Goes To Dinner, Let&#x2019;s Go To Prison</i>, and <i>The Brothers Solomon</i>, all of which underwhelmed, admittedly, but Melvin is worth watching, for sure.<br><br>Bob has had many other memorable roles on TV, most notably <i>The Larry Sanders Show</i>, <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> (CBS), and <i>The Office</i> (NBC). He is most proud of his appearances in James Ponsoldt's <i>The Spectacular Now</i> and Alexander Payne&#x2019;s <i>Nebraska</i>.<br><br>He is currently Executive Producing, writing, and co-starring in <i>The Birthday Boys</i>, a sketch comedy show for IFC to premiere in October, 2013.</p><p>"Bob Odenkirk is wrong.

Jennings separates myth from fact to debunk a wide variety of parental edicts: no swimming after meals, sit up straight, don&#x2019;t talk to strangers, and so on.<br> <br>Armed with medical case histories, scientific findings, and even the occasional experiment on himself (or his kids), Jennings exposes countless examples of parental wisdom run amok.

Jennings lives in Seattle with his wife Mindy and two children.Preface<br><br>I was sitting in my parents&#x2019; kitchen not long ago when my young son, Dylan, came whipping around the corner with a grape Tootsie Pop firmly clamped in his teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa, slow down!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What if you tripped and fell on your face? The lollipop stick would get jammed right through the roof of your mouth!&#x201d;<br> <br>Dylan&#x2019;s eyes got wide. &#x201c;Could that <i>really</i> happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had to admit, I had no idea. This was something my mother had told me repeatedly while I was growing up, but it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;d ever dug into the relevant medical literature or consulted with surgeons. What do you do when a nine-year-old calls your bluff?<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s true!&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Go sit down at the table until you&#x2019;re done with your lollipop.&#x201d; Just like with terrorists and bears! You can&#x2019;t show any doubt or weakness!<br> <br>I found my mom and asked her to back me up: it&#x2019;s true about lollipop sticks and horrific puncture wounds, right? She had no idea. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Grandma used to tell us,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think it also happens in a Chaim Potok novel. <i>The Chosen,</i> maybe?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was horrified. A fact I&#x2019;d confidently passed along to my trusting children turned out to be thirdhand rumor confirmed only by a <i>novelist</i>? (A novelist-slash-rabbi, but still. And it turns out the lollipop injury isn&#x2019;t in <i>The Chosen,</i> anyway. It&#x2019;s from <i>In the Beginning</i>.) What else had I been inadvertently misleading them about? Washing behind their ears? Chewing with their mouths closed? Was our whole life together <i>a huge lie</i>?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the dirty secret of parenting: it&#x2019;s a big game of Telephone stretching back through the centuries and delivering garbled, well-intended medieval bromides to the present. Possible misinformation like the lollipop thing never gets corrected; it just goes into hibernation for a few decades and then jumps out to snare a new generation, like a seventeen-year cicada. Parents find themselves in these factual blind alleys because they have no other resource than the dimly remembered thirty-year-old lectures of their own childhoods.<br> <br>Until now! In this book, I&#x2019;ve compiled 125 of the nagging Mom- and Dad-isms that we all grew up with, and then I&#x2019;ve meticulously researched the scientific evidence behind them. On some, I&#x2019;m happy to deliver a clear-cut verdict one way or another: either confirming them as &#x201c;True&#x201d; or debunking them as &#x201c;False.&#x201d; More often, though, the truth falls somewhere in between: true with an &#x201c;if,&#x201d; false with a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; Some of these parental clich�s turn out to be accidentally right for the wrong reason (see &#x201c;Eat your crusts, that&#x2019;s where the vitamins are!&#x201d; on page 90 or &#x201c;Never wake a sleepwalker!&#x201d; on page 165). Others are time-tested and unimpeachably sensible . . . but still don&#x2019;t always hold up well in real life (see &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to strangers!&#x201d; on page 57). So there are plenty of &#x201c;Mostly False&#x201d; and &#x201c;Possibly True&#x201d; verdicts in here as well.<br> <br>Much of the gray area is a matter of risk assessment. Human beings, as a rule, are terrible students of probability. As a result, we develop paranoid, nightmare-inducing phobias about the unlikeliest things (plane crashes, strangers kidnapping our kids) while ignoring far more pressing risks (heart disease, car accidents). I&#x2019;ve used the best statistics available to try to help you gauge the relative risks of different childhood activities, whether that&#x2019;s going outside barefoot or swallowing gum or running with scissors, but the final decision is always going to be a judgment call&#x2014;like so many other elements of parenting, an art and not a science.<br> <br>Take my mom&#x2019;s lollipop fear, for example. There is a fair bit of medical research on &#x201c;pediatric oropharyngeal trauma,&#x201d; which is what doctors call it when kids bash up their mouths on some foreign object. A 2006 study out of Edmonton estimated that fully 1 percent of childhood injuries are oropharyngeal traumas, and another study from Pittsburgh&#x2019;s Children&#x2019;s Hospital found that puncture wounds were indeed common outcomes. Twenty-nine percent of the injuries were serious: a large laceration, or a fistula (eww) or mucosal flap (don&#x2019;t know what that is, but double eww). Brain damage and death are extremely rare complications, but both have happened.<br> <br>So clearly I was justified in telling my son to sit down while finishing his lollipop, right? Well, maybe and maybe not. The Pittsburgh study also notes that most cases are minor and heal with no medical intervention at all, and then runs down the items that are most likely to cause this kind of trauma. Lollipops were one of the rarest culprits, causing less than 3 percent of the injuries studied and vastly outnumbered by pencils, musical instruments, toys, sticks, and so on. The hospital treated just one lollipop case every two years, on average. Meanwhile, the Tootsie Pop company alone makes twenty million lollipops <i>per day</i>. I guarantee that lots of those lollipops get eaten by kids on the go&#x2014;and yet injuries are rare. So the numbers suggest that, compared to lots of other common day-to-day activities, eating-a-lollipop-not-sitting-down isn&#x2019;t terribly reckless. There&#x2019;s a fine line between making kids cautious about dangerous horseplay and just making them panicky about totally normal stuff, like moving around with a pencil or harmonica or something in their mouths.<br> <br>Parents love their kids, of course, and would like to keep them safe from everything. But even if that were an achievable goal&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s not&#x2014;it might not be great in the long run for the poor kids involved. A 2009 <i>Time</i> magazine cover package on &#x201c;helicopter parents&#x201d; followed the first wave of hypercushioned, overparented American children into adulthood, and the results were depressing: mommy webcams in college dorms, employers like Ernst &amp; Young preparing &#x201c;parent packets&#x201d; for the pushy parents of new twentysomething hires. By trying to protect our kids from every little thing, we may have created a generation of kids and young adults who don&#x2019;t feel confident about <i>anything</i>. So the risks need to be measured against the rewards. What if there&#x2019;s a 0.95 percent chance that a kid who bikes to school will get in a wreck, but a 95 percent chance that a kid who&#x2019;s <i>not</i> allowed to bike to school will grow up more tentative, complacent, lazy, and/or unhappy, because riding your bike to school is awesome? I feel like those percentages might not be that far off.<br> <br>So I hope this book serves as a reality check for potentially jittery parents. But even if you don&#x2019;t have kids right now, you presumably were (or even are) one yourself. In that case, I hope this book helps inoculate you against the crazy things parents somehow still believe&#x2014;and when you take away the authoritative intonation, <i>lots</i> of parental wisdom is pretty nuts. Put butter on a burn? Wear a hat if your feet are cold? Drink <i>eight</i> glasses of water a day? Is that even possible?<br> <br>If you really want to know how silly much of our parental nagging sounds, ask someone from a different culture what parents harp on there. My Korean friends weren&#x2019;t allowed to sleep with an electric fan in their rooms, because a fan, they were told, would somehow asphyxiate them while they slept. In Russia, kids are warned not to sit on cold surfaces, or they&#x2019;ll freeze their gonads and wind up sterile. Germans and Czechs hear from a young age that they should never drink water after eating fruit, or they&#x2019;ll get a bellyache. Filipino children don&#x2019;t get to wear red when it&#x2019;s stormy, because red clothing attracts lightning. A friend&#x2019;s Iranian mother used to warn her against ever inhaling a cat hair. If you get one caught in your throat, she said, you&#x2019;ll just keep vomiting repeatedly <i>until you die</i>. I&#x2019;m not poking fun at these superstitions&#x2014;I just want you to realize how ridiculous our own old wives&#x2019; tales would sound to someone who&#x2019;s never heard them before. Wait an hour after eating to swim? If you cross your eyes, they might stay that way? How, an outsider might wonder, does anyone actually believe this stuff ?<br> <br>And yet there are times when the oddest and the oldest bits of parental folklore turn out to be true. There are now studies showing that cold, wet feet might indeed help cause a cold and that chicken soup can fight one. Double-dipping potato chips does spread germs. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. Occasionally, Mom knew what she was talking about.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve intentionally limited this book to propositions that can easily be tested scientifically, by doctors and statisticians and so forth. I&#x2019;ve tried to back away slowly from vaguer points of parental philosophy: minefields like homeschooling, circumcision, co-sleeping, TV banning. Anything your weird sister-in-law is always talking about on Facebook is out, basically. Sadly, I also had to avoid areas where the science is still hotly debated and inconclusive, which meant leaving out a lot of very modern parental worries: video games and social media and whatnot. In twenty years, maybe I can write a sequel in which we finally find out what was up with phthalates in plastic toys, predators on the Internet, and cell phones causing cancer. But I&#x2019;m not sure how long that will take&#x2014;TV is over sixty years old and experts <i>still</i> disagree on how that affects kids. So don&#x2019;t hold your breath. (Holding your breath for too long <i>is</i> bad for you, according to a broad scientific consensus.)<br> <br>I know there&#x2019;s no way one book can stamp out <i>all</i> the lies parents tell their kids. You&#x2019;re still going to have safety lies (&#x201c;The car won&#x2019;t run unless your seat belts are on!&#x201d;) and cheapskate lies (&#x201c;Honey, when the ice cream man is playing music, it means his truck is all out of ice cream&#x201d;) and sympathy lies (&#x201c;We sent your hamster to live on a farm&#x201d;) and keep-your-kids-out-of-therapy lies (&#x201c;We love you both exactly the same!&#x201d;). But the <i>accidental</i> lies should be easier to tackle. It&#x2019;s time to shine the cold, hard light of truth onto controversial behaviors like sitting too close to the TV, eating toothpaste, and sneezing with your eyes open.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not too late! Future generations will thank us.</p><h2>Hot Monogamy: Essential Steps to More Passionate, Intimate Lovemaking</h2><p>Co-authored with best-selling writer Jo Robinson, Hot Monogamy guides individuals and couples through a personal experience which unfolds secrets to long-lasting love.

Yet forceful writing is one of the most potent weapons of legal advocacy. In this new edition of <i>Writing to Win</i>, Steven D.&nbsp;Stark, a former lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, who has inspired thousands of aspiring and practicing lawyers, applies the universal principles of powerful, vigorous prose to the job of making a legal case&#x2014;and winning it.<br><br><i>Writing to Win</i> focuses on the writing of lawyers, not judges, and includes dozens of examples of effective (and ineffective) real-life legal writing&#x2014;as well as compelling models drawn from advertising, journalism, and fiction. It deals with the&nbsp;challenges lawyers face in writing, from organization to strengthening and editing prose;&nbsp;offers incisive&nbsp;ways of improving arguments; addresses litigation and technical writing in all its forms; and covers the writing attorneys must perform in their daily practice, from email&nbsp;memos&nbsp;to briefs and contracts. Each chapter opens with a succinct set of rules for easy reference.<br><br>With new sections on client communication and drafting affidavits, as well as updated material throughout, <i>Writing to Win</i> is the most practical and efficacious legal-writing manual available.</p><p><p>Steven D. Stark is a former cultural commentator for CNN, National Public Radio, and the Voice of America. He has written frequently for the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and both the <i>Boston Globe </i>where he was an op-ed columnist and the <i>Montreal Gazette</i> where he was a world sports columnist. A former Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School, he is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School.</p><p>Introduction&nbsp;to the New Edition<br><br>Good writing is timeless. Except, of course, when it&#x2019;s not.<br><br>Periodically over the last ten years, I thought about revising my original book on legal and professional writing&#x2014;<i>Writing to Win:&nbsp;The Legal Writer. </i>But as egocentric as it might seem, for a while I never found much I would change. Sure, some of the references marked the book as a product of a slightly earlier time&#x2014;the references to the O. J. Simpson trial, Kenneth Starr, or &#x201c;vice-president Al Gore.&#x201d; But for the most part, the book seemed to illustrate the maxim that the principles of good writing don&#x2019;t change all that much over time. A good brief in 1965&#x2014;much less in the late 1990s when the book was written&#x2014;is still a good brief today. Ditto for complaint writing, contracts, and even judicial opinions.<br><br>And yet: In a variety of ways, writing in many parts of the legal and business worlds has changed more since that book was written about a decade ago than in any comparable period over the last five centuries. &#x201c;We shape our tools and then our tools shape us,&#x201d; wrote the media theorist Marshall McLuhan a generation ago. Technological changes transform not only the methods of communication but their style as well. The invention of the printing press centuries ago not only altered the dissemination of information in Western cultures, it changed the way people spoke and the way they wrote&#x2014;and there were constant complaints about it then, just like now.<br><br>In our time, of course, the recent development of computers, the Internet, and then smart phones (and all their manifestations, such as the iPad) has begun to do much the same thing. It&#x2019;s undeniable that writing within the office and for clients is dramatically different than it was a decade ago. Whether we recognize it or not, that means that legal analysis and the ways we approach business problems have shifted as well.<br><br>These revolutionary changes are one of the subjects of this new edition of the book. In part, that makes this volume a primer on how to communicate successfully in this brave new world. Writing effective e-mails and shorter memos are skills very much at odds with the tools we acquire in school&#x2014;where the goal is usually to be expansive and detailed as we display our knowledge in all its minutiae. These new forms of communication are also very different from the written and oral tools one needed to master to be a good lawyer or executive, circa 1990 and before.<br><br>Yet it&#x2019;s not just these new forms one needs to master. Litigation and contract writing may not have begun to change much since the rise of e-culture. But they will, since it is inevitable that these documents will also be read differently as the years pass, as will even judicial opinions. Some courts now require e-filings. Justices Antonin Scalia and Elena Kagan read briefs on either an iPad or a Kindle, and they will soon be joined by many others.<br><br>It means, too, that a lawyer&#x2019;s role and habits of mind will change as they have begun to do already. If the Internet, Twitter, and Facebook are altering the way we do our jobs and how well we do them, they&#x2019;re changing the way we think as well. It was Professor Kingsfield in <i>The Paper Chase </i>who kept dwelling on the importance of &#x201c;thinking like a lawyer.&#x201d; How that&#x2019;s changed at the beginning of the twenty-first century because of these technological shifts is the subject of this new edition too.<br><br>Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new focus reinforces many of the fundamental principles that writing teachers and books (including my previous volume) have been stressing for decades&#x2014;use strong verbs or be concise&#x2014;though the rationales for doing so have changed somewhat. Yet other suggestions are novel, as one might expect at the dawn of a new epoch.<br><br>This updated edition also has an increased spotlight on creative writing as it relates to the presentation of facts and argument, as well as a new section on how affidavits need to be better drafted so that they reflect the true voice of the person they are supposed to represent. And, throughout the text, there are new ideas and examples of both what to do and avoid.<br><br>There is an old Chinese curse: May you live in interesting times. Whether it&#x2019;s a curse or not, we live in just such an era. So let&#x2019;s begin to figure out how to adapt&#x2014;the sooner the better.</p></p><h2>The Gospel in Genesis: From Fig Leaves to Faith</h2><p><p>In this series of never-before-published sermons, beloved teacher Martyn Lloyd-Jones walks readers through the early chapters of Genesis. <em>The Gospel in Genesis</em> starts with the fall of man and ends with the call of Abram as it examines portions of chapters 3-12. Along the way Lloyd-Jones talks of serpents and sin, of the Word of God and the Babel of man. But the destination of <em>The Gospel in Genesis</em> is clear: readers will be moved from fig leaves in the garden to faith in the gospel.</p><p>Thus Lloyd-Jones preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ from the pages of Genesis. These nine sermons will snap nonbelievers out of their apathy toward God and will embolden believers to share the only gospel that offers answers to life's biggest questions.</p></p><p><p><strong>Martyn Lloyd-Jones</strong> (1899&#x2013;1981), minister of Westminster Chapel in London for&nbsp;thirty years, was one of the foremost preachers of his day.

Decades later, the intense spiritual journey continues, with a story that combines the thrills of a wilderness adventure with the awe-inspiring elements of a paranormal novel.</p><p>In March of 1980, college senior Peter Panagore went ice climbing on the world-famous Lower Weeping Wall, along the Ice Fields Parkway in Alberta, Canada. His climbing partner was an experienced ice climber, but Panagore was a novice. On their descent, they became trapped on the side of the mountain.

Heaven was beautiful.</p><p>Panagore's death experience changed his life and resulted in an intense spiritual journey that has continued for decades. It impelled him to pursue a master's degree at Yale Divinity School, focusing on systematic theology and Christian mysticism.

He blogs regularly at www.dontknowmuch.com.</p>In looking at early America, from Spanish explorations to Shay&#39;s Rebellion, Davis starts by mentioning Flip Wilson and a comedy sketch about Queen Isabella. &#34;History should be much more fun than most Americans believe it is,&#34; he explains before turning things over to narrator Sam Freed. Some anecdotes, describing the earliest &#34;forensic dentistry&#34; or the importance of a broken egg, are fun, but Freed mostly plays it straight. He&#39;s no lecturer, though; Freed&#39;s narration tells a dramatic story. Listeners may have heard some of these stories before--like the one about George Washington&#39;s alleged war crime--but will still enjoy the spin Davis and Freed put on these historic events.

It deals with the darkness, the despair and the joy that are inherent in the quest for enlightenment and self-knowing. Though focused mainly on issues relating to recovery from various kinds of addictions, the principles presented in this tale hold true for all spiritual journeys. The story of The Dark Night of Recovery is in the form of an ongoing dialogue between a relative newcomer to recovery (Lawyer Bob) and an old-timer (Tyler) who meet every two weeks to discuss life and turmoil and love and lust and everything else. Each of the twelve chapters deals with one of the Twelve Steps, using the wisdom of the Tao, the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, Winnie the Pooh, Yoda, Thomas Merton and many others. The story line follows Bob as he struggles through personal and spiritual problems, trying to apply the principles he is learning. At the end of the twelve sessions, Bob (and hopefully the reader) has acquired a few more skills to apply to the art of living one day at a time.</p><p>Edward Bear, a pseudonym, was born in Brooklyn, NY and grew up in Los Angeles. Early experiences include a brief stint in minor league baseball, too many years in construction work, day labor, bartending, and a variety of dead-end jobs. He attended (sometimes very briefly) six colleges and received no degrees. A correspondence course in engineering landed him a job at Hewlett-Packard, where has been employed for 27 years. His major influences are Winnie the Pool, Eugene O&#39;Neill, John Steinbeck, Meister Eckhart, T.S. Eliot, and Jacques Maritain, not necessarily in that order. He has published several fiction pieces in small literary magazines and a novel, Diamonds Are Trump.<br><br><b>Prologue</b><br> <p>Most everybody knew old Tyler. He's been hanging around the Westside Alano club for as long as anyone could remember. Had a face looked like somebody forgot to water it; dry as an old boot, road-mapped with wrinkles, the face of a man who'd spent a good deal of time looking at horizons.</p> <p>Lawyer Bob was the guy who wore the Armani suits, had the House on the Hill, the Big Job. Had it all. Everybody figured him for Mister Success. Huh. Little did they know. He had a hole in his life the size of a suitcase. Bob was the one told me the story about how he and Tyler got together a year or so ago when Bob was having all that trouble. Anyway, he went to Tyler because he figured that anyone with thirty years in recovery out to have some answers. First thing Tyler told him was he didn't have any answers. First thing, like he was reading his mind. Then he went on.</p> <p>�Sounds like you�re about to enter the dark part of the forest. The part where the real work begins. You ready to go back school?�</p> <p>�I did the steps already,� said Bob.</p> <p>�Good. Once more won�t hurt. And try not to be defensive. I�m on your side.�</p> <p>I�m not being defensive.�</p> <p>You�re being defensive,� said Tyler. �Trust me on this; I know defensive when I see it. Now, it would seem that the preliminary work is done &#x2014; you have hit bottom sober. Very important. And now you are about to enter the Dark Night, the Great Desert, where you will either fall by the wayside and die, go mad, or survive and experience real recovery.�</p> <p>Thoer are the only choices?�</p> <p>�All spiritual journeys contain elements of death and transfiguration. Recovery�s no different. It�s just part of the deal.�</p> <p>�Sounds like major surgery,� said Bob.</p> <p>True. But the alternative is to stop growing and join those who linger in that gray limbo of semi-recovery, not drinking or using or feeding their other addictions, but not really living either, dispensing Advice and Tough Love to defenseless newcomers, glumly counting birthdays as if the sheer number might guarantee a certain amount of happiness. You want that?�</p> <p>�No.�</p> <p>�You want to be free?�</p> <p>�I want to be free.�</p> <p>�Good. We may be on to something here. How about we meet at your place every other Tuesday? Seven o�clock. You have a tape recorder?�</p> <p>�Yeah.�</p> <p>�good. Get some tapes. Long ones.�</p> <p>Why tapes?�</p> <p>�Mostly to humor an old man,� said Tyler. �And someday you may want to remember what it was like. You may even want to <i>tell</i>somebody what it was like. It�ll help you refresh your memory.�</p> <p>Bob said he tried to explain some of his numerous problems to Tyler that night, but Tyler wouldn�t listen.</p> <p>�You�ve just got one problem, counselor. You�re addicted to a wide variety of things, most notably alcohol, and that addiction, that state of dis-ease, results in a pathological obsession with self, a condition needlessly prolonged by your desire to figure it out. Figure-it-out-ism is itself a disease nearly always fatal in advanced cases. Like yours. Often leads to what�s-the-use-ism or poor-me-ism, both known to be terminal in addicts of all kinds. What you really have is a surrender problem.�</p> <p>�A surrender problem?�</p> <p>�I�ll explain later. For your first assignment, read up to page forty-five in the Big Book and explain what powerless means. Read Step One in the Twelve and Twelve. Read <i>the House at Pooh Corner</i> and write down the most important passage.�</p> <p><i>The House at Pooh Corner</i>?�</p> <p>�As in Winnie-the-Pooh,� said Tyler.</p> <p>�The most important passage in the whole book?�</p> <p>�It�s not <i>War and Peace</i>, Bob. It�s just a little book. And read Chapter 71 in the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>and tell me how it relates to the First Step.�</p> <p>�Tyler��</p> <p>�And that�s just the beginning. It�s like life &#x2014; the lessons just keep coming. Suit up and show up and be ready. And one other thing.�</p> <p>�Yeah?�</p> <p>�Try smiling once in a while. It�s just life. Far as I know, nobody�s getting out of this thing alive. Might as well enjoy the journey. See you in two weeks?�</p> <p>�I�ll be there.�</p> <p>�And so will I. Fasten your seat belt, counselor; you are about to embark on the journey of your life.�</p> <p>Bob asked me if I�d transcribe the tapes, me being a writer and all. Two articles in the local paper and I�m a writer. Of course, I don�t discourage the notion. So here they are &#x2014; The Tyler Tapes (with only slight editing by yours truly).

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.When Gregory Groundhog and his shadow are separated just before February 2, their need to find each other and provide the all-important weather report is acute. Each has an adventure-filled outing before he teams up to wow the assembled crowd about the possible early end of winter. Jim Weiss has a knack for enlivening a story with just the right touches of suspense, animal voices, and judicious pacing. Listeners come away feeling as if they've been right there when Gregory's shadow talks with Scarecrow, when the shadowless Gregory trudges dejectedly to the barn, and when the farmer's feast is shared. Young listeners will enjoy Groundhog Day lore from a new perspective. A.R. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>1941: The Year Germany Lost the War: The Year Germany Lost the War</h2><p><b>Bestselling historian Andrew Nagorski takes a fresh look at the decisive year 1941, when Hitler&#x2019;s miscalculations and policy of terror propelled Churchill, FDR, and Stalin into a powerful new alliance that defeated Nazi Germany. </b><br><br>In early 1941, Hitler&#x2019;s armies ruled most of Europe. Churchill&#x2019;s Britain was an isolated holdout against the Nazi tide, but German bombers were attacking its cities and German U-boats were attacking its ships. Stalin was observing the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, and Roosevelt was vowing to keep the United States out of the war. Hitler was confident that his aim of total victory was within reach.<br> <br> \By the end of 1941, all that changed. Hitler had repeatedly gambled on escalation and lost: by invading the Soviet Union and committing a series of disastrous military blunders; by making mass murder and terror his weapons of choice, and by rushing to declare war on the United States after Japan&#x2019;s attack on Pearl Harbor. Britain emerged with two powerful new allies&#x2014;Russia and the United States. By then, Germany was doomed to defeat.<br> <br> Nagorski illuminates the actions of the major characters of this pivotal year as never before. <i>1941: The Year Germany Lost the War</i> is a stunning examination of unbridled megalomania versus determined leadership. It also reveals how 1941 set the Holocaust in motion, and presaged the postwar division of Europe, triggering the Cold War. 1941 was a year that forever defined our world.</p><p>Andrew Nagorski served as <i>Newsweek</i>&#x2019;s bureau chief in Hong Kong, Moscow, Rome, Bonn, Warsaw, and Berlin. He is the author of six previous critically acclaimed books, including <i>Hitlerland</i> and <i>The Nazi Hunters.</i> He has also written for countless publications. Visit him at AndrewNagorski.com.1941: The Year Germany Lost the War INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>On June 28, 1940, shortly after the German invasion of France and that country&#x2019;s capitulation, Adolf Hitler visited Paris for the first and only time in his life. During the mere three hours he spent in the French capital, there was no victory parade. The ostensible reason was the fear of British air raids. But the German leader later offered another explanation: &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t at the end yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that point, Hitler&#x2019;s Germany had reached its apogee. It had already dismembered Czechoslovakia, annexed Austria, and conquered Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, culminating in its especially satisfying humiliation of France. The German military machine looked to be unstoppable.<br> <br>Nonetheless, Hitler understood that his messianic dream of a new Germanic empire was only partially fulfilled. Three leaders stood in his way. Britain&#x2019;s Winston Churchill, who replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister at the moment that France fell, was proclaiming Britain&#x2019;s defiance and determination to fight back. The Soviet Union&#x2019;s Joseph Stalin remained a de facto but uncertain ally since the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact less than a year earlier, with neither tyrant completely trusting the other not to strike. And across the Atlantic, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was promising to keep the United States out of the conflict, but there was no doubt about his sympathy for an increasingly isolated Britain.<br> <br>So instead of participating in military festivities in Paris, Hitler used the short visit as an opportunity to get a quick look at the city&#x2019;s cultural landmarks.<br> <br>Accompanied by his favorite architect Albert Speer and other aides, he drove directly to the Paris Opera, where an attendant took him on a tour of the empty, lavishly ornamented building. According to Speer, Hitler &#x201c;went into ecstasies about its beauty.&#x201d; Then the German delegation took in the Madeleine church, the Champs-�lys�es, and the Trocadero before making another brief stop, this time at the Eiffel Tower.<br> <br>The highlight of the tour, though, was Les Invalides, where Hitler lingered at Napol�on&#x2019;s tomb. Pierre Huss of the International News Service was one of a small group of correspondents from Berlin who were allowed to witness the scene. The Nazi leader looked lost in his thoughts. &#x201c;He folded his arms and murmured something we could not hear,&#x201d; Huss recalled. &#x201c;His lips moved, as if he were talking to himself, and once or twice he shook his head.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hitler came &#x201c;out of his trance&#x201d; and leaned forward on the balustrade to stare down at Napol�on&#x2019;s tomb. &#x201c;Napol�on, mein lieber, they have made a bad mistake,&#x201d; he said. Huss admitted: &#x201c;It startled me, standing there across from a live warlord and a dead emperor.&#x201d; The correspondent also did not understand what Hitler meant.<br> <br>The German leader promptly explained to everyone around him: &#x201c;They have put him down into a hole. People must look down at a coffin far below them. . . . They should look up at Napol�on, feeling small by the very size of the monument or sarcophagus above their heads. You do not impress people if you walk in a street and they are on top of a building. They must look at something above them; you must be the stage and center of attraction above the level of all eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hitler was applying the same principles of staging that had proven devastatingly effective at his rallies as he rose to power. In talking about Napol�on, he was also talking about himself. &#x201c;I shall never make such a mistake,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;I know how to keep my hold on people after I have passed on. I shall be the F�hrer they look up at and go home to talk of and remember. My life shall not end in the mere form of death. It will, on the contrary, begin then.&#x201d; H. R. Knickerbocker, another Berlin-based American correspondent, wrote that it would be wrong to dismiss the analogies between Napol�on and Hitler. &#x201c;Hitler is the nearest thing to Napol�on since Napol�on,&#x201d; he argued in his book Is Tomorrow Hitler&#x2019;s?, which was published in 1941, after he had left Germany. He quoted a French colonel who had marveled at Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201c;miraculous sense of timing,&#x201d; and explained to American readers that the German leader&#x2019;s military successes were a result of the fact that he was &#x201c;always right.&#x201d; As if catching himself, Knickerbocker tacked on a caveat: &#x201c;Well, nearly always.&#x201d;<br> <br>As far as Hitler was concerned, no qualifiers were necessary. On the evening when he returned from Paris to his temporary field quarters in a northern French village, he invited Speer to join him for dinner. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t Paris beautiful?&#x201d; he declared. &#x201c;But Berlin must be made more beautiful.&#x201d; Then he added casually: &#x201c;In the past, I often considered whether we would not have to destroy Paris. But when we are finished in Berlin, Paris will only be a shadow. So why should we destroy it?&#x201d;<br> <br>While Hitler knew that he had not yet achieved total victory, his message was that it was coming soon&#x2014;and Speer needed to start making preparations for a capital worthy of the new empire and its brilliant modern-day emperor. As Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel put it in the aftermath of the French campaign, Hitler had proven himself to be &#x201c;the greatest military commander of all time.&#x201d; By then, according to the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, the German people had convinced themselves that Hitler was their messiah or at least the equivalent of an Old Testament prophet who would &#x201c;lead them to the Promised Land.&#x201d;<br> <br>To the growing ranks of the true believers, victory was no longer a question of &#x201c;if&#x201d; but &#x201c;when.&#x201d;<br> <br>A competing narrative was beginning to take shape even before Hitler&#x2019;s visit to Paris and his subsequent return to Berlin, where he was welcomed with cheers, strewn flowers, and the ringing of bells across the city. It was carefully crafted by Churchill, first in his speeches and then in his memoirs. Following the collapse of France and the spectacular evacuation of 338,000 British and Allied troops from Dunkirk by the Royal Navy and a flotilla of small boats, the prime minister rallied his countrymen with his famous speech on June 4, 1940. Facing a possible German invasion, he pledged to &#x201c;defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets; we shall never surrender . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>But for all that imagery of resistance on land, the next battles were in the skies over England. There, in what became known as the Battle of Britain, Germany suffered its first defeat. The Luftwaffe could not cripple the Royal Air Force, which was bolstered by an influx of Polish, Czech, and Commonwealth pilots. Hitler thereby failed to gain the air superiority his forces needed to launch an invasion of that island nation. &#x201c;Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization,&#x201d; Churchill told the House of Commons on June 18, rallying his countrymen and all those who were seeking to liberate their occupied lands to make this &#x201c;their finest hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>In many accounts of the war, this is presented as the critical period marking the end of Hitler&#x2019;s string of victories and the beginning of the reversal of fortunes that would lead to Germany&#x2019;s defeat. &#x201c;The Second World War seemed to have been decided early&#x2014;not in May 1945, but after less than a year, in June 1940,&#x201d; wrote German historian Christian Hartmann. To a limited extent, this is accurate. The Battle of Britain was the first turning point&#x2014;but it fell far short of a decisive one.<br> <br>And despite Churchill&#x2019;s insistence that he had always believed in victory, he was not immune to moments of doubt. In the largely overlooked recollections of Scotland Yard detective W. H. Thompson, his longtime bodyguard revealed one such occasion. Returning from his meeting with King George VI at Buckingham Palace on May 10, 1940, after Chamberlain had tendered his resignation and German troops launched their invasion of France, Churchill was uncharacteristically subdued.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know why I have been to Buckingham Palace, Thompson?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Thompson replied that he understood that the king had &#x201c;at last&#x201d; asked him to form a new government. &#x201c;I only wish that the position had come your way in better times, for you have taken on an enormous task,&#x201d; he added.<br> <br>Churchill had tears in his eyes as he replied: &#x201c;God alone knows how great it is. I hope that it is not too late. I am very much afraid that it is. We can only do our best.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was nothing inevitable about the subsequent sequence of events. As John Winant, who frequently traveled to London and would become US ambassador to Britain in 1941, pointed out: &#x201c;You could not live in London in those early years and not realize how narrow was the margin of survival. It would have taken so few mistakes to bring about defeat. . . . There were many times in the early years of the war when you felt that the sands would run out and all would be over.&#x201d;<br> <br>In fact, Joseph Kennedy, Winant&#x2019;s predecessor as ambassador, had not only advocated a policy of appeasement but also widely predicted that Britain would not be able to withstand the Nazi onslaught. After Poland fell in September 1939, Kennedy reported that military experts were not giving Britain, backed by its French ally, more than a &#x201c;Chinaman&#x2019;s chance&#x201d; against Germany. Both in Washington and London, he was seen as &#x201c;a defeatist,&#x201d; and he kept predicting Britain&#x2019;s demise even after his return to the United States.<br> <br>Another foreign ambassador in London, the Soviet envoy Ivan Maisky, wrote in his diary on May 20, 1940, as France was collapsing: &#x201c;The Anglo-French bourgeois elite is getting what it deserves. . . . We are witnessing the fall of the great capitalist civilization, a fall similar in importance to that of the Roman Empire.&#x201d; Despite his close social ties with many top British officials, Maisky was relishing what he saw as Britain&#x2019;s&#x2014;and, by extension, the whole capitalist world&#x2019;s&#x2014;comeuppance.<br> <br>As for the defeated French, most of their leaders saw no choice but to accept Hitler&#x2019;s armistice, which meant nothing less than surrender. They not only predicted that Britain would follow their example but sounded eager for it to do so. The French military commander General Maxime Weygand offered a bleak prediction: &#x201c;In three weeks, England will have her neck wrung like a chicken.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even some of Churchill&#x2019;s staunchest supporters could not help but feel despair as the German blitzkrieg rolled across France. Conservative MP Harold Nicolson made a suicide pact with his wife, the poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, securing poison pills they pledged to use if they were about to be captured by German invaders. In a letter to Sackville-West, Nicolson wrote that he did not fear that kind of &#x201c;honourable death.&#x201d; What he did fear, however, was &#x201c;being tortured and humiliated.&#x201d;<br> <br>Churchill soon managed to lift the spirits of Nicolson and most of his countrymen, aided by the heroism and skill of the pilots who prevailed in the Battle of Britain. Their successes forced the indefinite postponement of Operation Sea Lion, the German plan for an invasion of Britain, in September.<br> <br>Nonetheless, for the rest of 1940, the war could be described as an uneven stalemate. England had not collapsed, but waves of German bombers took part in the Blitz, dropping their deadly cargo on London, Coventry, and other cities. In the Battle of the Atlantic, U-boats and other German vessels targeted British ships, seeking to further isolate the lone holdout against the Nazi tide. On most of the Continent, the new German masters reigned supreme, unleashing a previously unimaginable reign of terror to subjugate the local populations. The decisive turning points had not been reached yet.<br> <br>But they would be in 1941.<br> <br>What transpired in that critical year set the trajectory that would lead to Nazi Germany&#x2019;s ultimate destruction. It was the year of Germany&#x2019;s &#x201c;attack on the whole world,&#x201d; as German writer Joachim K�ppner put it. By the end of 1941, Hitler had taken almost every wrong decision possible. His early successes in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union that he launched in late June, had turned into the first defeat of the German army on the outskirts of Moscow. His decision to make mass murder and terror his weapons of choice, not just in the first stages of the Holocaust but also in his treatment of Soviet POWs and others in the newly conquered territories, were already beginning to work against him.<br> <br>The leader who seemed to be so &#x201c;gloriously right,&#x201d; as the American correspondent H. R. Knickerbocker had put it earlier, was by then disastrously wrong.<br> <br>What accounted for this stunning turnaround in the short span of one year? What possessed Hitler to gamble again and again, raising the stakes each time? Once it was clear that Britain was not going to be added to his list of quick conquests, he gambled on delivering a swift knockout blow to the Soviet Union. When that failed, he not only welcomed Japan&#x2019;s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but rushed to declare war on the United States, thereby putting an end to the efforts of isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First movement to keep their country out of the conflict. As a result, Churchill&#x2019;s Britain could boast two new powerful allies: the Soviet Union and the United States.<br> <br>And what possessed Hitler to pursue a policy of terror and enslavement as his armies scored their initial successes in the western Soviet Union, where many Soviet POWs and local inhabitants would have otherwise welcomed any invader who promised liberation from Stalin&#x2019;s tyranny? One key part of that rule-by-terror approach was &#x201c;the Shoah by bullets&#x201d; carried out by Einsatzgruppen, special squads assigned the task of shooting Jews, Gypsies, and other &#x201c;enemies&#x201d; of Nazi rule. It was no accident that 1941 was the year when the Holocaust was set in motion, although the further coordination of the logistics was then left to the Wannsee Conference that took place on January 20, 1942.<br> <br>To outsiders and even to some of his inner circle, Hitler&#x2019;s actions in 1941 often looked like lunacy. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that he had chosen a path that could only lead to the destruction of his country, his movement, and himself. But a &#x201c;deranged monster&#x201d; theory hardly provides adequate explanation for the fateful course he charted, or the mayhem perpetrated in his name. Nor does it explain the roles of the Allied leaders who benefitted from his key miscalculations and parlayed them into a strategy that led to victory in 1945.<br> <br>World War II was much more than a clash of two opposing political and military alliances. It was at heart a worldwide struggle instigated by a man and a movement whose race-based ideology and inner conviction of infallibility defied common sense. Yet at the same time, it was propelled by a perverse internal logic based on a worldview that made perfect sense to its creator and his devoted followers.<br> <br>Nineteen forty-one would prove to be the year when the war escalated into a truly global conflict, with Hitler scoring impressive short-term tactical victories while condemning his Third Reich to defeat.

We learn as much about growing up in the Christian right as we do about gay life in Mel White&#x2019;s heartfelt and revealing memoir."&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Examiner</i></b><br><br>Until Christmas Eve 1991, Mel White was regarded by the leaders of the religious right as one of their most talented and productive supporters. He penned the speeches of Ollie North. He was a ghostwriter for Jerry Falwell, worked with Jim Bakker, flew in Pat Robertson's private jet, walked sandy beaches with Billy Graham. What these men didn't know was that Mel White&#x2014;evangelical minister, committed Christian, family man&#x2014;was gay.<p>In this remarkable book, Mel White details his twenty-five years of being counseled, exorcised, electric-shocked, prayed for, and nearly driven to suicide because his church said homosexuality was wrong. But his salvation&#x2014;to be openly gay and Christian&#x2014;is more than a unique coming-out story. It is a chilling expos� that goes right into the secret meetings and hidden agendas of the religious right. Told by an eyewitness and sure to anger those Mel White once knew best, <i>Stranger at the Gate</i> is a warning about where the politics of hate may lead America... a brave book by a good man whose words can make us richer in spirit and much wiser too.</p></p><p><b>Mel White</b> is a writer, filmmaker, and former ghostwriter of books, authobiographies, and speeches for Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Jim Bakker, and Oliver North. He is the author of such inspirational bestsellers as <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</i> and <i>Tested by Fire</i>. Dr. White serves as the National Minister of Justice for the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches from his position as Dean of Dallas's Cathedral of Hope (M.C.C.), the largest gay and lesbian church in the world. He lives with his husband, Gary Nixon, in Dallas, Texas.Mel White, an evangelical minister and former ghostwriter for Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and other prominent leaders of the religious right, here describes his half-century-long struggle to accept himself as a gay Christian. Deeply angered by the recent gay-bashing tactics of his former clients, White says he could stand to ``be a ghost no longer''; after years in the closet, writing for others, he finally had to tell his own story. He leads us though his shame-ridden adolescence, his anguishing attempts to make his marriage work, his high-speed career as a Christian writer and minister, and, perhaps most painfully, his attempts to ``cure'' himself of homosexuality through prayer, electric-shock therapy, and guilt. White's is the story of a ``man of God'' enduring nearly unbearable suffering before finding the strength to preach the good news. It is also a coming-out story. White's style suffers, at points, from the pitfalls of clich&#x201a; and polemical simplification. Yet his ability to reconcile his divergent identities, as preacher and gay man, gives his voice a unique, impassioned confidence. His tale is inspired, and strengthened, by a commitment to two warring communities. He seeks acceptance and civil rights for other gay men and lesbians yet also wants to deliver his fellow Christians from their own hatred. Readers will be moved by White's search for an accepting community, which he finally finds in the Metropolitan Community Church, a gay and lesbian nondenominational Christian congregation. Stranger at the Gate is likely to provoke useful dialogue among mainstream Christians and to offer unsentimental hope and comfort to many who are struggling to reconcile homosexual desires with hostile, yet deeply valued, religious traditions. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now available for the first time in years, <em>The Days of the French Revolution</em> brings to life the events that changed the future of Western civilization. As compelling as any fiction thriller, this real-life drama moves from the storming of the Bastille to the doomed court of Louis XVI, the salon of Madame Roland, and even the boudoir of Marie Antoinette. Hibbert recounts the events that swirled around Napoleon, Mirabeau, Danton, Marat, and Robespierre with eyewitness accounts and his "usual grace and flair for divulging interesting detail" (Booklist). This trade paperback edition has twenty-eight pages of black-and-white illustrations, and will be published in time for Bastille Day.<p></p></p><p>"Never was any such event so inevitable yet so completely unforeseen." Alexis de Tocqueville's 19th-century assessment of the French Revolution echoes the contemporary reaction to the monumental events that took place over 200 years ago. Christopher Hibbert's superb historical narrative <i>The Days of the French Revolution</i> captures de Tocqueville's immediacy but tempers it with the hindsight of history. Detailing events from the meeting of the Estates General at Versailles in 1789 to the coup d'�tat that brought Napoleon to power 10 years later, <i>The Days of the French Revolution</i> captures the passion and ferocity motivating the events and the individuals that most dramatically shaped the Revolution.<p> Originally published in 1990, <i>The Days of the French Revolution</i> maintains its supremacy among the plethora of French Revolution histories. An acclaimed author of over 25 historical and biographical studies, Hibbert presents complexly related events in a logical, readable format and supplies plenty of historical background and detail without sacrificing clarity or narrative flow. He writes for the general reader unfamiliar with Revolution history, introducing them to individuals as diverse as Marie Antoinette, the young lawyer Danton, the journalist Marat, and the Girondin, sans-culotte and extremist Enrag� political factions, weaving their fates together, and adeptly illustrating how they influenced the Revolution and how the Revolution, in turn, changed their lives. Maps, illustrations, a chronology of principle events, a glossary, and a list of major sources supplement Hibbert's eight chronologically ordered chapters, and his prologue, which focuses on the reign of Louis XVI, sets the scene for the events of 1789. At the same time entertaining and informative, <i>The Days of the French Revolution</i> allows its readers to forget that they are reading a book of history. <i>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Church History For Latter-day Saint Families</h2><p>Most publications about the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints seem to be written for historians and scholars, but this volume promises to be a trusted resource for families, teachers, and youth.

Working undercover around the globe, the FBN's charismatic &#x201c;case-making&#x201d; agents penetrated the Mafia and its French connection. In the process, however, they uncovered the national security establishment&#x2019;s ties to organized crime. Victims of their freewheeling methods and unparalleled success in hunting down society&#x2019;s predators, the agents were ultimately targeted for destruction by the FBI and CIA. Based largely on interviews with case-making agents, The Strength of the Wolf provides a new, exciting, and revealing chapter in American history.</p><p>Douglas Valentine is the author of five non-fiction books: The Hotel Tacloban (1984), The Phoenix Program (1990), The Strength of the Wolf (2004), The Strength of the Pack (2009), and the CIA as Organized Crime (2017).

An evil that lurks in the dark. The SCU returns in a hair-raising novel from&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Kay Hooper.</b><br><br> Nellie Cavendish has very good reasons to seek out her roots, and not only because she has no memory of her mother and hardly knew the father who left her upbringing to paid caregivers. In the eight years since her twenty-first birthday, very odd things have begun to happen. Crows gather near her wherever she goes, electronics short out when she touches them, and when she&#x2019;s upset, really upset, it storms. At first, she chalked up the unusual happenings to coincidence, but that explanation doesn't begin to cover the vivid nightmares that torment her. She can no longer pretend to ignore them. She has to find out the truth. And the only starting point she has is a mysterious letter from her father delivered ten years after his death, insisting she go to a town called Salem and risk her life to stop some unnamed evil. Before her thirtieth birthday. <br><br> As a longtime member of the FBI's Special Crimes Unit, Grayson Sheridan has learned not to be surprised by the unusual and the macabre--but Salem is different. Evidence of Satanic activities and the disappearance of three strangers to the town are what brought Salem to the attention of the SCU, and when Gray arrives to find his undercover partner vanished, he knows that whatever&#x2019;s hiding in the seemingly peaceful little town is deadly.&nbsp; But what actually hides in the shadows and secrets of Salem is unlike anything the agents have ever encountered.</p><p><b>Kay Hooper</b> is the award-winning, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Bishop/Special Crimes Unit series and the Bishop Files series.<b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Kay Hooper and her novels</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;A dark thriller that plunges readers into the disturbing side of the paranormal.&#x201d;&#x2014;Fresh Fiction<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Filled with page-turning suspense.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Sunday Oklahoman</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A stirring and evocative thriller.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Palo Alto Daily News</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When it comes to delivering the creepy and supernatural, Hooper is on a roll.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>RT Book Reviews</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Kay Hooper has given you a darn good ride, and there are far too few of those these days.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Dayton Daily News</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It passed the &#x2018;stay up late to finish it in one night&#x2019; test.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Denver Post</i></p><h2>Tissue Salts for Children: Babies, Tots, Teens</h2><p>The 12 key tissue salts are minerals that should be present in our bodies in perfect balance to ensure optimal health.

Now a wave of talk and laughter met my ear, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t what had wakened me.<br> <br>No, it was the smell.<br> <br>It teased me, growing stronger and then fainter&#x2014;so faint I thought, for a moment, that I had dreamed it. But then it was back again, a rich, deep, meaty aroma that set all the waters in my mouth to flowing. I rose to one elbow and breathed it in, imagining tearing into a hunk of my mother&#x2019;s roasted mutton, feeling the warmth of it going down and the heavy, drowsy ease of a full belly.<br> <br>I straightened my cap on my head, hitched my knapsack to my shoulder, and wobbled to my feet. It had been two days since I had finished the last of my provisions, and hunger had made me weak.<br> <br>The voices dimmed and then swelled again. It was dark; even the stars had vanished. The crowds had thinned, and the men who passed me now seemed somehow sinister, their faces distorted by the shadows of the lanterns that had begun to flicker to life. Beyond the quays the shops and houses of Bergen stood resolutely shoulder to shoulder, solid and prosperous, leaving no room for a starveling waif such as I.<br> <br>I crept down the street and rounded a corner into an alley, where I spied an inn before me, light blazing from its windows. The rich fragrance of meat assailed me more powerfully than before, flooding my nose and mouth and throat. I told myself that it was fruitless to torture myself with tantalizing aromas. That, without coin, I would be unwelcome in a place such as this. That I might even find myself in peril.<br> <br>I pushed open the door. I stepped within.<br> <br>The inn was dim and crowded, rank with the commingled odors of sweat and sour ale and wet wool and mud. But the smell of warm meat wafted all about and underneath the other smells, and it lured me in deep. A serving maid brushed past me bearing a tray above her head. She slapped it down on a table: a mound of roasted rabbit sitting in a puddle of gravy and blood. Men in blue, sailor&#x2019;s garb thronged in about it, digging in with hands and knives. The meat vanished from the platter so quickly it was hard to credit, until a single leg joint lay there alone.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t think; I moved.<br> <br>I slipped between two seamen who were reaching for it, snatched up the rabbit haunch, and ran hard for the door.<br> <br>A shout: &#x201c;Hey! You, boy!&#x201d; Then more shouts, and curses, and a scraping of benches behind me. &#x201c;Halt, thief!&#x201d;<br> <br>Someone seized my cloak from behind, nearly toppling me. I twisted round and laid eyes on him&#x2014;a blond, brawny sailor of maybe fifteen years; maybe three years older than I. I kicked his shin and then tore myself away. I scrambled up onto a table and stumbled toward the other side, knocking over a row of flagons and a pitcher of ale.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hands reached for my legs. I dodged, stumbling into a trencher full of meat, then leaped from the table and made for the door. I pushed it open. Knocked into a man coming in. Slipped and fell to the ground&#x2014;all without releasing my grip on the rabbit haunch. I scrambled to my feet and headed into the darkness, praying that the sailors behind me would be too lazy or too drunk to follow.</p><h2>Manetho: History of Egypt and Other Works (Loeb Classical Library No. 350)</h2><p>Manetho was an Egyptian of the 3rd century BCE. Born probably at Sebennytus in the Delta, he became a priest or high priest at Heliopolis. Apparently he and a Greek Timotheus did much to establish the cult of Serapis in Egypt. Eight works or parts of works were ascribed to him, all on history and religion and all apparently in Greek: <i>Aegyptiaca,</i> on the history of Egypt; <i>The Sacred Book</i> on Egyptian religion; <i>An Epitome of Physical Doctrines; On Festivals; On</i> Ancient Ritual and Religion; On the Making of Kyphi (an incense); <i>The Criticisms of Herodotus;</i> and the spurious <i>Book of S�this.</i> These survive only as quoted by other writers.

He lives in South Carolina with his wife and their three children.</p>An established master of military SF, Weber, and a fast-rising comer in the genre, Ringo, combine forces in the first of a new series sure to please their fans. Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock has a problem. Thanks to terrorist sabotage, he and a company of space marines are marooned in the wilderness of the planet Marduk, noted for high mountains, high temperatures, low technology and the short tempers of its nine-foot, four-armed, slime-covered natives. They have to get out of this place. In their effort to do so, they win allies among the Mardukans (mostly in legitimate ways) and overcome others by judiciously combining sneakiness and firepower. Along the way, the prince turns from a spoiled brat into a useful, even valuable member of the company. This coming-of-age theme often crops up in military SF, and indeed both authors are working within territory they know well. The pace never gets too slow, despite generous world-building and extended action scenes. Another strength is the deceptively deep characterization particularly of Prince Roger, whose transformation draws on skills and character traits carefully planted early in the novel. The book could actually use more background (the villainous terrorist Saints are shadow figures) and ends on a cliff-hanger (or cliff-climber), but overall the superb storytelling will add considerably to the reputation of both authors.

Nothing could save the sensitive child but her talent for words, music, and drama, and an inexorable desire to be loved. When she was twenty, her poetry would make her famous; at thirty she would be loved by readers the world over.</p><p>Edna St. Vincent Millay was widely considered to be the most seductive woman of her age. Few men could resist her, and many women also fell under her spell. From the publication of her first poems until the scandal over <i>Fatal Interview</i> twenty years later, gossip about the poet's liberated lifestyle prompted speculation about who might be the real subject of her verses.</p><p>Using letters, diaries, and journals of the poet and her lovers that have only recently become available, Daniel Mark Epstein tells the astonishing story of the life, dedicated to art and love, that inspired the sublime lyrics of Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p></p><p>Poet, playwright, and translator Daniel Mark Epstein certainly has the right background to understand and evaluate poet, playwright, and translator Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950)--though Millay didn't write biographies. Readers of Epstein's <i>Sister Aimee</i> and <i>Nat King Cole</i> will recognize the intense personal engagement the author brings to his task. He's not afraid to express an almost physical fascination for his subjects, which is especially appropriate for the flamboyant Millay, who insisted on the right to take as many lovers as she pleased and to write about them in some of the greatest erotic poetry in American verse. Epstein focuses on that poetry, deciphering the affairs that fueled it and elucidating the boldly iconoclastic, almost cynical acceptance of love's fleeting nature that informs it. (Of the last sonnet in <i>A Few Figs from Thistles</i>, with its notorious putdown, "I shall forget you presently, my dear / So make the most of this, your little day," he remarks: "For a woman, not yet thirty, to compose and market such a poem... was a scandal, an alarm, and a red flag to censors.") While the Edna St. Vincent Millay who emerges in Nancy Milford's <i>Savage Beauty</i> is indelibly shaped by her upbringing, particularly her relationship with her mother and sisters, Epstein's Millay is a self-created goddess of love and literature. It's fascinating to compare these two biographies, published nearly simultaneously and each with considerable merits. Milford's lengthy book, the product of three decades of research, is lavish with details and comprehensive in scope. Epstein's more selective work excels in cogent summaries and forcefully stated opinions. Either book will satisfy readers with an interest in Millay or American literature; really passionate aficionados of the art of biography will want to read both. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><p><b>Daniel Mark Epstein</b> is an award-winning essayist, poet, playwright, translator, biographer, and musician.

Combining finely minced beef, sliced offal, herbs, and a fragrant spice mixture that threatens to numb the tongue, it&#x2019;s a world away from the spicy, tart &#x201c;larb&#x201d; found in Thai restaurants abroad&#x2014;or even in Bangkok. Indeed, accompanied by a bamboo basket of steaming sticky rice and a platter of herbs, vegetables, and bitter greens, these are ingredients and flavors that are really only available in Thailand&#x2019;s north. For me, it&#x2019;s the kind of meal that&#x2019;s worth the risky drive.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been visiting places like Um Phang since I moved to Thailand in 1999. I originally came to the country on a scholarship at Chiang Mai University, where I learned to speak, read, and write Thai. After I was done studying, I landed a job teaching English. During school breaks I&#x2019;d travel the country, going to remote places, camera in hand&#x2014;an effort, I suppose, to wrap my head around the place where I was living. But it didn&#x2019;t take me long to realize that food is almost certainly the best way to learn about Thailand. I was both overwhelmed by and obsessed with Thailand&#x2019;s cuisine, but I also found food a way to improve my language skills, meet people, and learn about the culture. Since then, I&#x2019;ve worked as a writer and photographer, having contributed to more than twenty books for the travel publisher Lonely Planet and other publications. I started an acclaimed blog about Thai food, and shot the photos for Andy Ricker&#x2019;s Pok Pok cookbooks.&nbsp;<br><br>For most of this time, I&#x2019;ve lived in Bangkok, epicenter of the &#x201c;pad Thais&#x201d; and green curries that have made Thai food so famous worldwide. Yet it took&nbsp;traveling outside the capital to learn that Thai food is anything but a single entity. Nearly twenty years of eating in just about every part of the country have taught me that, from region to region, Thailand&#x2019;s flavors, ingredients, cooking methods&#x2014;even for staples like rice&#x2014;differ immensely. And it&#x2019;s these uniquely regional dishes&#x2014;a fish curry at a roadside stall on an island in southern Thailand that was so intensely spicy I was, momentarily, high; an unexpectedly sweet and fragrant salad of raw minced buffalo eaten at the edge of a rice field in Thailand&#x2019;s north; a crunchy, intensely herbal stir-fry of dried cobra served from a shack in central Thailand&#x2014;that I&#x2019;ve found myself most frequently drawn to.<br><br>Yet of Thailand&#x2019;s vast spread of regional cuisines and dishes, I find that I keep coming back to those of the country&#x2019;s north. The food of northern Thailand is a world away from the highly refined, royal court&#x2013; and Chinese-influenced style of cooking associated with Bangkok and central Thailand&#x2014;the Thai food that most of us are familiar with. It&#x2019;s a cuisine with its own distinct identity, one that is rustic and earthy, meaty and fragrant; one with roots in the Thai repertoire but with branches that extend beyond the country&#x2019;s borders; a cuisine that manages to feel ancient and contemporary, domestic and foreign, all at the same time.<br><br>Led to remote destinations in the course of work, I&#x2019;ve had the chance not only to eat northern Thai dishes in every province in the region but also to talk with northern Thai home cooks, restaurateurs, and academics. I have photographed rural markets and cooked with locals. I have spent time in libraries, poring over old texts and recipes, and hours in the kitchens of food vendors and housewives. From these experiences, I have assembled a body of knowledge and photographs of a cuisine that few in Bangkok know much about, let alone those in the English-speaking world.&nbsp;<br><br>What, then, is northern Thai food? We have the rest of this book to explore that question, but for now, my mind flits to sitting on the floor, cross-legged, at the edge of a short, squat table, plucking sticky rice from a bamboo basket. I&nbsp;think of rolling that rice into a ball with my fingers and swiping it into dips that are smoky, spicy, and salty. I&#x2019;m reminded of soups packed with so many herbs that identifying a single one is an almost impossible task. Of hazy grills stacked with mysterious banana leaf packages, coils of sausage, and unidentifiable pork parts. And of home cooks preparing food from muscle memory, not recipes. To me, northern Thai food means dishes made from raw meat that are as delicious as they are intimidating. And noodle soups that are so fundamentally, effortlessly tasty that there&#x2019;s no barrier to entry; they&#x2019;re just plain <i>good</i>, no matter what you grew up eating.<br>Death thwarted, I pull into Um Phang, but only to find that the laap shack is gone. Instead, there&#x2019;s a shiny new 7-Eleven&#x2014;Um Phang&#x2019;s first&#x2014;by far the brightest and most modern building around, drawing the town&#x2019;s hungry like moths to a flame.<br><br>Nearly two decades of documenting food in Thailand have also instilled in me a sense of urgency. The way people eat is changing rapidly and profoundly. Across the country, modernization and increasing wealth are having a huge impact on Thai food. A Western-style diet is becoming the norm, and these days, hot dogs can seem as common as tom yam. Likewise, Thailand&#x2019;s local cuisines are becoming increasingly homogenous, and the current generation of cooks is probably the last who will have been direct witness to the full vastness of the country&#x2019;s culinary diversity.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is not an encyclopedia of northern Thai food. The recipes included here are not meant to define the cuisine, nor are they exhaustive. Rather, they stem from six provinces in northern Thailand that boast particularly vibrant culinary legacies. Nor is this book meant to be a nostalgic reminiscence of what people used to eat. My hope is that it can serve as a snapshot of the culinary world of northern Thailand as it stands today, of the people, dishes, ingredients, and cooking techniques that form this unique, fascinating, and delicious cuisine.<br><br><b>Naam Phrik Num</b><br><br>A Northern Thai-Style Dip of Grilled Chilies, Shallots, and Galic <br>Serves 4<br><br>&#x201c;It should be spicy,&#x201d; offers Areerat Chowkasem, a former restaurant cook, from her home kitchen in Mae Rim, outside of Chiang Mai.<br><br>Overt heat is unusual for a northern Thai dish. But <i>naam phrik num</i>, a dip revolving around grilled chilies, is the exception to this rule.&nbsp;<br><br>The dish consists of little more than northern Thailand&#x2019;s famous slender green chilies&#x2014;the eponymous phrik num&#x2014;garlic and shallots, grilled over coals until charred, soft, and fragrant, before being pounded with seasonings using a mortar and pestle.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pound the chili too finely,&#x201d; explains Areerat while gently blending the ingredients with the pestle; naam phrik num shouldn&#x2019;t have the consistency of a uniform paste, but rather that of a tangle of pale green, spicy strands.<br><br>It&#x2019;s this simplicity&#x2014;and also that heat&#x2014;that has made naam phrik num the flagship dish of the northern Thai repertoire, beloved by just about everybody and sold at every market&#x2014;including from souvenir stalls at Chiang Mai International Airport.<br><br>Traditionally, the dip is eaten with sticky rice, steamed or parboiled vegetables, and ideally also some deep-fried pork rinds (see page 70). Yet it also functions equally well as a dip for <i>sai ua</i> (northern Thai&#x2013;style sausage; page 74), or, my personal favorite, deep-fried chicken. Similarly, countless variations on <i>naam phrik num</i> exist, in which its core elements are supplemented with ingredients ranging from deep-fried pork rinds to grilled fish (see opposite and page 44 for two of these).<br><br><i>Phrik num </i>are unavailable outside of northern Thailand, but Andy Ricker, in his book <i>Pok Pok</i>, suggests that mild Anaheim, Hungarian wax, or goat horn chilies, supplemented with spicier serrano chilies, serve as an acceptable substitute. Traditionally, <i>naam phrik num </i>is seasoned with little more than salt, but Areerat, somewhat unconventionally, opts for soy sauce; I&#x2019;ve gone with a balance of the two. If you want to go completely old-school, you can eliminate this ingredient altogether and season your <i>naam phrik num</i> to taste with salt or even plaa raa, unfiltered fish sauce.<br><br><b>For the Dip </b><br>500 grams / 18 ounces large fresh chilies (ideally <i>phrik num</i>, or a combination of serrano and other milder chilies) <br>80 grams / 3 ounces shallots, unpeeled <br>12 garlic cloves, unpeeled (60 grams / 2 ounces total) <br>1 teaspoon table salt <br>1 teaspoon white soy sauce (optional)&nbsp;(see page 328)<br><br><b>For Serving</b><br> 600 grams / 1 1/3 pounds of parboiled or steamed vegetables, such as pumpkin, cabbage, long bean, small eggplant, and/or raw vegetables, such as cucumber or Thai eggplant, cut into bite-sized pieces <br>160 grams / 5 1/2 ounces deep-fried pork rinds (see page 70) <br>sticky rice (see page 54)&nbsp;<br><br><b>THAI KITCHEN TOOLS </b><br>Thai-style charcoal grill or barbecue metal or bamboo skewers (the latter soaked in water), or a grilling basket<br><br><b>1. </b>Using a Thai-style charcoal grill, light the charcoal and allow the coals to reduce to medium heat (approximately 350�F to 450�F, or when you can hold your palm 3 inches above the grilling level for 5 to 7 seconds).&nbsp;<br><br><b>2. </b>Skewer the chilies, shallots, and garlic separately.

And two giants at the foundations of modern science were converging, step-by-step, on the answer: Albert Einstein, an young, obscure German physicist experimenting with measuring time using telegraph networks and with the coordination of clocks at train stations; and the renowned mathematician Henri Poincar�, president of the French Bureau of Longitude, mapping time coordinates across continents. Each found that to understand the newly global world, he had to determine whether there existed a pure time in which simultaneity was absolute or whether time was relative.<br><br> Esteemed historian of science Peter Galison has culled new information from rarely seen photographs, forgotten patents, and unexplored archives to tell the fascinating story of two scientists whose concrete, professional preoccupations engaged them in a silent race toward a theory that would conquer the empire of time. 40 b/w illustrations</p><p>Peter Galison is Mallinckrodt Professor for the History of Science and of Physics at Harvard University. He is a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship and the Max Planck Prize, as well as the Pfizer Prize for the Best Book in the History of Science for Image and Logic.*Starred Review* Many have taken it as proof of Einstein's transcendent genius that he published his epoch-making Theory of Relativity while employed as a clerk in the Bern patent office, a place usually judged more likely to extinguish scientific inspiration than to kindle it. But when Harvard historian Galison takes a close look at that patent office, he sees something quite different. He sees an institution flooded with patent applications for technologies to coordinate distant clocks, applications forcefully highlighting the problem of simultaneity that lies at the very heart of relativity. Perhaps for some few it will diminish Einstein's accomplishment to realize how much his circumstances helped to focus his thinking. But for most it will only clarify his intellectual feat. Galison helps readers to understand how Einstein--no reclusive hermit--both learned from and surpassed contemporary scientists, engineers, and philosophers struggling to redefine time in a world newly unified by railroads, telegraphs, and radio. And no contemporary more closely paralleled Einstein in his pioneering path than the gifted French mathematician and cartographer Henri Poincare. An admirer of Poincare's neglected brilliance, Galison shows how the French scholar independently unraveled most of the mysteries of relativity, even partially anticipating Einstein's key breakthrough in redefining "local time." Still, while Poincare tried to integrate his insights into the Newtonian framework, Einstein recognized that relativity demanded an entirely new conceptual structure. Few books have ever made Einstein's work more accessible--or more engrossing--for general readers. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this powerful book, Beryl Satter identifies the true causes of the city's black slums and the ruin of urban neighborhoods throughout the country: not, as some have argued, black pathology, the culture of poverty, or white flight, but a widespread and institutionalized system of legal and financial exploitation. </p><p>In Satter's riveting account of a city in crisis, unscrupulous lawyers, slumlords, and speculators are pitched against religious reformers, community organizers, and an impassioned attorney who launched a crusade against the profiteers&#x2015;the author's father, Mark J. Satter. At the heart of the struggle stand the black migrants who, having left the South with its legacy of sharecropping, suddenly find themselves caught in a new kind of debt peonage. Satter shows the interlocking forces at work in their oppression: the discriminatory practices of the banking industry; the federal policies that created the country's shameful "dual housing market"; the economic anxieties that fueled white violence; and the tempting profits to be made by preying on the city's most vulnerable population. </p><p><i>Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America</i> is a monumental work of history, this tale of racism and real estate, politics and finance, will forever change our understanding of the forces that transformed urban America. </p><br><p>"Gripping . . .

Unlike the Obamas, Albert and Sallie Bolton had to purchase their home on an installment plan, because in the 1950s federal agencies refused to insure mortgage loans for buyers in racially integrated areas. Facing severely limited options, the Boltons contracted to pay the then-princely sum of $13,900 for a 100-year-old cottage without central heat. The seller, a white real estate agent named Jay Goran, specialized in just this kind of deal: He sold properties for a down payment of only a few hundred dollars, but if the purchasers missed even one installment, Illinois law allowed him to quickly and easily obtain an eviction order for less than $5. After the Boltons signed the contract, Goran added extra fees to their monthly bills. When they called to complain, he refused to speak to them. Then came repeated visits from housing code inspectors: First the couple had to remove their shutters, then rebuild the front porch, then fix the back porch. After 18 months, the Boltons fell behind on a payment, and Goran filed for eviction. Prospective buyers were already showing up at the house when the young couple sought help from a hardscrabble Chicago lawyer, Mark Satter. The novel lawsuit that Satter filed on behalf of the Boltons succeeded only in postponing their ouster until 1959. But in the meantime, Satter researched Goran's tactics, learning, for example, that the real estate speculator had purchased the house for $4,300 just a week before he sold it to the Boltons for triple the price, and that he recently had filed repossession claims on 20 other properties. Satter used the information to publicize how the rigid racial segregation of Chicago's housing market cost the city's black citizens $1 million a day in inflated prices and rents. Now his daughter, Rutgers University history professor Beryl Satter, has turned the story of her father and the Boltons into a penetrating examination of the financial discrimination that thousands of African Americans encountered in their northward migration to cities such as Chicago. Redlining is a familiar, if poorly understood, word for the refusal to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods. Satter shows how it worked in vivid, personal terms. Her painstakingly thorough portrayal of the human costs of financial racism is, in my view, the most important book yet written on the black freedom struggle in the urban North. In "Family Properties," she explains that it was not poverty that made black Chicagoans vulnerable to the likes of Jay Goran, because in 1960 two-thirds of the city's whites and 63 percent of its black residents had comparably modest incomes. Rather, she contends, the blame belongs squarely on "the racially biased credit policies of the nation's banking industry" and particularly the pre-1965 Federal Housing Administration. Following procedures in effect since the 1930s, appraisers rated properties using a color scheme: green for all-white areas, blue and yellow for areas with some foreigners or Jews, and red for areas with black residents. "The FHA's appraisal policies," Satter writes, "meant that blacks were excluded by definition from most mortgage loans" and that "the presence of a single black family usually led to mortgage redlining" of an entire neighborhood. Non-commercial purchasers (white as well as black) found themselves unable to obtain loans in those locations. Speculators like Goran pressed frightened white homeowners to sell, then quickly "flipped" the houses to families like the Boltons, who had no alternative method for buying a home. For black purchasers struggling to make inflated monthly payments, dividing and overcrowding their properties to generate income was a common solution. But that choice sapped aging structures, and it strained the fabric of many communities. In Chicago's tough West Side neighborhood of Lawndale, for instance, school enrollment increased 286 percent between 1951 and 1965. Even more than Hyde Park, Lawndale plays a central role in Satter's book, both because it experienced the worst concentration of Goran-style real estate sales and because it's where her father grew up. In the 1920s and '30s, when Mark Satter was a boy, the neighborhood was largely Jewish. He attended law school on scholarship, dabbled briefly in the Communist Party and gradually bought four small Lawndale apartment buildings to supplement his modest law practice. Between 1940 and 1960, Chicago's African American population surged from 277,000 to 812,000, and Mark Satter was one landlord who happily rented to blacks. "He was passionately, ideologically dedicated to the ideal of an interracial community in Lawndale," his daughter writes. In 1953, however, construction of what today is the Eisenhower Expressway "sliced the neighborhood in two and essentially destroyed it." The following year Mark Satter moved his family to a more middle-class area, and in 1955 Lawndale's major Jewish institutions decamped as the neighborhood became predominantly black. Real estate rip-offs proliferated. Satter was just 6 when her father died in 1965 at age 49, exhausted by his losing struggle to keep his Lawndale properties in respectable shape. Soon after his death, a grassroots group called the Contract Buyers League emerged and fought back against unfair real estate contracts by picketing banks and withholding payments to exploitative agents such as Goran. It had mixed success -- 70 families lost their homes -- but its battles led to congressional enactment of mid-1970s mortgage reform laws that improved banks' home loan practices and that Satter views as the "crowning achievement" of the activism her father pioneered. Half a century after her 1959 eviction, Sallie Bolton, now 88, still lives on Chicago's South Side, although not as close to the Obama family's grand home as she once briefly did. Predatory lending practices have reemerged in the form of subprime loans, and Satter reports that "between 2004 and 2006 the American city with the most residents holding subprime loans was . . . Chicago." "Family Properties" is a superbly revealing and often gripping book, one that will remind Chicagoans on temporary assignment in Washington all too poignantly of home. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Yet all his life Strayhorn was overshadowed by his friend and collaborator Duke Ellington, with whom he worked for three decades as the Ellington Orchestra's ace songwriter and arranger. A "definitive" corrective (<i>USA Today</i>) to decades of patchwork scholarship and journalism about this giant of jazz, David Hajdu's <i>Lush Life</i> is a vibrant and absorbing account of the "lush life" that Strayhorn and other jazz musicians led in Harlem and Paris. While composing some of the most gorgeous American music of the twentieth century, Strayhorn labored under a complex agreement whereby Ellington took the bows for his work. Until his life was tragically cut short by cancer and alcohol abuse, the small, shy composer carried himself with singular style and grace as one of the few jazzmen to be openly homosexual. <i>Lush Life</i> has sparked an enthusiastic revival of interest in Strayhorn's work and is already acknowledged as a jazz classic.</p></p><p>A 1996 nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award, this perceptive, meticulously researched biography rescues from obscurity the gifted Billy Strayhorn (1915-67), Duke Ellington&#39;s arranger and composer of many popular Ellington Orchestra tunes, including &#34;Take the `A&#39; Train.&#34; Worshipped by jazz aficionados as the creative power behind the Ellington throne, Strayhorn preferred to live quietly while his friend/boss took the bows. In clear prose and with careful attention to nuance, David Hajdu documents Strayhorn&#39;s contributions to the Ellington magic and delineates an attractive personality who found good in almost everyone he met.Billy Strayhorn (1915-1967) was one of the most accomplished composers in the history of American music, the creator of a body of work that includes such standards as &#34;Take the &#39;A&#39; Train&#34;, &#34;Lush Life&#34;, and &#34;Something to Live For&#34;. Yet all his life Strayhorn was overshadowed by another great composer: his employer, friend, and collaborator, Duke Ellington, with whom he worked as the Ellington Orchestra&#39;s ace songwriter and arranger. Lush Life, David Hajdu&#39;s sensitive and moving biography of Strayhorn, is a corrective to decades of patchwork scholarship and journalism about this giant of jazz. It is also a vibrant, absorbing account of the &#34;lush life&#34; led by Strayhorn and other jazz musicians in Harlem and Paris. A musical prodigy who began a career as a composer while still a teenager in Pittsburgh, Strayhorn came to New York City at Duke Ellington&#39;s invitation in 1939; soon afterward he wrote &#34;&#39;A&#39; Train&#34;, which became the signature song of the Ellington Orchestra, one of the most popular jazz bands in the country. For the next three decades, Strayhorn labored under a complex agreement whereby Ellington thrived in the role of public artist to Strayhorn&#39;s private one, often taking the bows for Strayhorn&#39;s work. Strayhorn was alternately relieved to be kept out of the limelight and frustrated about it. In Harlem and in the cafe society downtown, the small, shy black composer carried himself with singular style and grace as one of the few jazzmen to be openly homosexual. His compositions and elegant arrangements made him a hero to other musicians, but when he died at age fifty-two, his life cut short by alcohol abuse and cancer, few people fully understood the vital role he played in theEllington Orchestra&#39;s development into a vehicle for some of the greatest, most ambitious American music of this century.</p><h2>Death of a Chimney Sweep (A Hamish Macbeth Mystery, 26)</h2><p><i>From the author of the Agatha Raisin television series...</i><b>DEATH OF A CHIMNEY SWEEP: A Hamish Macbeth Mystery</b>In the south of Scotland, residents get their chimneys vacuum-cleaned. But in the isolated villages in the very north of Scotland, the villagers rely on the services of the itinerant sweep, Pete Ray, and his old-fashioned brushes. Pete is always able to find work in the Scottish highlands, until one day when Police Constable Hamish Macbeth notices blood dripping onto the floor of a villager's fireplace, and a dead body stuffed inside the chimney. The entire town of Lochdubh is certain Pete is the culprit, but Hamish doesn't believe that the affable chimney sweep is capable of committing murder. Then Pete's body is found on the Scottish moors, and the mystery deepens. Once again, it's up to Hamish to discover who's responsible for the dirty deed--and this time, the murderer may be closer than he realizes.</p><p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series.

For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.The Scottish Highlands that Beaton depicts with such skill are beautiful and sinister, a fitting backdrop to her Hamish Macbeth series and especially to this one, her twenty-sixth craggy-cozy. The mystery centers in the tiny Highlands village of Drim, &#x201c;a huddle of white-washed cottages&#x201d; on the banks of a sea loch, where mountains rise up at water&#x2019;s edge. There, the body of the posh new owner of a long-abandoned estate is found, stuffed up the chimney. The chimney sweep himself, who was to have been cleaning the estate chimney, is found dead on the motorway, an apparent accident victim, a few hours later. The local police feel the case is open and shut, with the chimney sweep tabbed as the murderer of the estate owner, until Constable Hamish Macbeth questions the findings, even of the forensics team. Someone has embarked on a spree, starting at the estate, and spreading to Edinburgh.

Think about what you learned about the brain in school. More often than not, any lessons about the human brain entailed a long list of vocabulary words and facts about brain structures, neurons and dendrites that were boring and difficult to grasp. I would also guess that there probably wasn't any explanation of what these various brain structures actually do and how they affect you in your own life.<br><br>If this sounds similar to what you experienced in school, then get angry and prepare to start a revolution. The fact that we are not taught about the amazing complexity of the human brain, the importance of helping it work right, and the connection between our brain and our life is insane. When you begin to grasp some of the practical and easily understood brain basics, you will be amazed to learn that you have the power to improve your brain and have a better life. By understanding the inner workings of your brain and how they relate to all aspects of your life, you'll begin to understand why you are the way you are, and why you act the way you act. Your tendencies, your struggles, your personality&#x2014;all of these come from your brain. But it's not like you're just born with the brain you have and you've got that brain your whole life. Once you realize that, the amount of power and influence you have over the functioning of your own brain&#x2014;and, by association, your life&#x2014;becomes clear. This is when the magic happens.<br><br>Of course, before you become the master of your brain, it is important to start with the brain basics. The eight brain facts in this chapter may appear absurdly simple and commonsensical. Well, this is true, and that's the beauty of it. What you will find after reviewing each of these brain basics (information that's based largely on the work I did with Dr. Amen during my time at the Amen Clinics) is that you have probably never stopped to put it all together. Perhaps you've known this information all along, but when you couple it with the powerful program in this book that will help you change the way your brain works, things will begin to click. And you will undoubtedly give your brain the respect it deserves.<br><br>Before you read any further, take the Brain Systems Quiz, which was adapted from the work I have done with Dr. Amen, to give you better insight into which parts of your brain might be contributing to some of the frustrations and/or struggles in your life. Please rate yourself honestly on each of the items in the list. Follow the instructions at the end of the quiz to determine what your answers mean. After you've analyzed your answers, put the quiz aside. We'll come back to the results later on.<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #1: You Are Your Brain</strong><br><br>As profound as this might sound, the simple fact is that you are a construct of your brain. Let's think about this for a second. Your heartbeat, bodily functions, organs, movements, thoughts, moods, actions, reactions, interactions, personality, memories, health, spirituality, happiness, feelings, relationships, successes, energy, focus, creativity, failures, problem-solving skills, anxieties, diet, decisions, hurts and dreams are all dependent upon the moment-by-moment functioning of the three-pound supercomputer housed within your skull. Your brain is involved in every aspect of your life. It controls everything.<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #2: Your Brain Is Ridiculously Complex</strong><br><br>As much as we have learned about the brain in just the past decade, we still have not even scratched the surface of understanding how incredibly complicated the human brain is. In fact, many argue that there is nothing in the universe more complicated than the human brain. <em>Nothing.</em><br><br>Your brain is estimated to have more than one hundred billion neurons within it, and these neurons have trillions of supporting cells. To complicate things further, each of these trillions of supporting cells can have as many as forty thousand connections (called synapses) between them. This means that a piece of your brain tissue the size of a <em>grain of sand</em> has more than one hundred thousand neurons with more than one billion synapses all talking to one another. The critical consensus is that there are more connections in your brain than there are stars in the known universe.<br><br>The brain is estimated to hold the equivalent of about six million years' worth of the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em> Information travels through your brain at an impressive 268 miles per hour. And although your brain accounts for only about 2 percent of your body's weight, it burns nearly 30 percent of the calories you consume. When we look at the overall temperature of the organs in the human body, the brain is like a massive heat center, burning energy from the food you give it. It works faster and harder than any other organ to manage everything it is responsible for. (This means that you literally are what you eat. Chapter 14 will give you much more insight into the power of food and how it can aid in the healing or hurting of your brain.)<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #3: Your Brain Is Not Fully Developed Until Age Twenty-Five</strong><br><br>The title of this book was purposely chosen to highlight this critically important brain fact. We may like to assume that we are adults when we turn eighteen; however, the truth is our brain is still undergoing a significant amount of construction until our midtwenties. Research has shown that the brain is not fully developed until a person reaches about the age of twenty-five. For some males, full development can extend until age twenty-eight.<br><br>What does this mean for you? If you are under twenty-five, this means every decision you make, every thought you have, every action you take, all the food you eat, the amount of sleep you get and <em>everything else</em> you do throughout your day has a significant impact on your developing brain. In short, what you are doing now can affect the rest of your life.<br><br>The more effort you make in taking care of your brain and optimizing it now, the better your chances of achieving your goals and dreams. Conversely, the more you harm your brain now, the more difficult things will be in your future. (Chapter 2 will cover the developing brain in much greater detail.)<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #4: Your Brain Is Quite Fragile</strong><br><br>When we think of the human brain, we often imagine a rubbery, firm organ. This is probably because the brains we have seen outside of skulls are typically kept in formaldehyde, which makes the brain firmer and more rubbery than it really is. Your living brain has about the same consistency as warm butter, an egg white, soft gelatin or soft tofu. If I were able to take the top of your skull off, I could stick my hand in your brain and mush everything around to create one giant mess. Now that's a terrifying thought.<br><br>Of course, your brain is surrounded by fluid and housed in a protective skull, but this is often taken for granted. While your skull protects your brain, the brain is still quite vulnerable. When you house something that is very soft in a compartment that is very hard with ridges along the sides that can be as sharp as knives, disaster can strike if proper care is not taken.<br><br>I want you to think of some scenarios in which the phenomenon of a soft brain surrounded by liquid and encased in a hard skull would be a negative. Perhaps you thought of Newton's first law of motion: an object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by an external force. In our case, if your head is in motion and then comes to a sudden stop, your brain keeps moving until it smacks against the skull. Then, depending on the severity of the impact, your brain might also bounce the other way and smack against the opposite side of the skull. Anytime this happens, damage to your brain occurs. Car accidents, blunt force trauma and falling out of a second-story window are all obvious ways to damage your brain. What about the less obvious ways we can damage our brain? playing. In Ethan's case, his brain scan showed repeated injury, flattening and damage to his prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain in charge of attention, focus, impulsivity, planning and organization. (You will learn much more about this part of the brain in Chapter 3.)<br><br>Football is another dangerous sport. Our brains were not designed to be put inside a helmet and then slammed against other helmets. An average tackle on a stationary player can result in up to sixteen hundred pounds of tackling force, with an impact speed of twenty-five miles per hour. Football is the sport with the highest rate of concussions for male athletes. Players have a 75 percent chance of sustaining one.<br><br>Nearly 50 percent of athletes who have suffered a concussion do not report feeling any symptoms, which can include headache, fatigue, sleep difficulties, personality changes, sensitivity to light/ noise, dizziness, deficits in short-term memory, difficulty with problem solving, and a general decrease in academic functioning. In some cases, these symptoms are permanent and disabling. And if you have sustained one concussion, you are one to two times more likely to sustain a second one. If you have had two concussions, you are two to four times more likely to sustain a third one. If you have had three concussions, you are three to nine times more likely to sustain a fourth one.<br><br>(Chapters 7 and 8 will cover many of the other ways that young people hurt their brains and how this affects their overall chances for a happier, healthier and wealthier life.)<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #5: When Your Brain Works Right, You Work Right</strong><br><br>Think of what happens when the hard drive on your computer is not functioning at its best. It could be due to a virus, the fragmentation of data, clutter or a host of other issues. What happens when there is a problem with the engine of your car? It doesn't run quite right. Fuel might not be used as efficiently, the engine might be working too hard to get itself going, or it might lose some of the power necessary to move the car efectively.<br><br>Many people don't realize that the human brain works in a very similar way. When your brain is working right, you have a much greater chance of working to your full potential. This is when you have the greatest access to yourself&#x2014;who you really are and what you can really do&#x2014;and have the ability to achieve the goals you have set for yourself.<br><br>But what happens if your brain is not working right? Chances are that you might be having some trouble in your life. This can happen if your brain is underactive, or not working hard enough in certain areas. It can also happen if your brain is overactive, or working <em>too</em> hard in certain areas. I'll talk more about this later in the book.<br><br>The images you see below show a comparison between two brains that are very different from each other. The brain on the left is an actual brain scan of a healthy person, taken with the use of SPECT imaging (which looks at blood flow and activity). This person's brain is full, even and symmetrical. It's a nice-looking brain. The image on the right, however, is an actual brain scan of a person who has been using methamphetamines for a number of years. You can clearly see global deficits of brain function scattered throughout. It is important to note that this person's brain does not actually have holes in it. The areas appearing to have holes are actually specific regions of the brain that are underactive in terms of blood flow and activity.<br><br>Throughout this book, you will see many detailed images of the brain that indicate brain injuries and the use of drugs and alcohol. You will also explore the underlying biological mechanisms behind brain struggles, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and many others. (I use the term <em>brain struggles</em> to describe a broad spectrum of brain-related issues that people experience, whether it's a diagnosable disorder or simply a behavioral tendency that causes difficulty in a person's daily life.) The important questions you have to ask yourself now as you look at these two images are, Which of these two people has the best chance of success, and which of these two people has the greatest access to his or her true personality and potential?<br><br><strong>Brain Fact #6: Certain Parts of the Brain Are Associated with Certain Behaviors</strong><br><br>New and exciting research has brought us an impressive amount of information about the brain, though there is an overwhelming amount of information we still do <em>not</em> know. One of the more exciting discoveries concerns which parts of the brain are associated with specific behaviors and tendencies. Thanks to the information that has been amassed, we have begun to understand that problems in certain parts of the brain tend to cause specific symptoms and struggles.<br><br>Although there are many important parts of the human brain that have been connected to behaviors and success (e...g., the occipital lobes, the parietal lobes, the temporal lobes, the cerebellum and so on), this book focuses on the few parts that relate most to the developing brain.<br><br></p><h2>Lead with Humility: 12 Leadership Lessons from Pope Francis</h2><p>In the years since his election to the highest position in the Catholic Church, Pope Francis has breathed life into an aging institution, reinvigorated a global base, and created real hope for the future. His early accomplishments have been so remarkable that in 2014, Fortune magazine awarded the top spot of their coveted World&#x2019;s Greatest Leaders list not to a captain of industry or political leader but to the new pontiff. But how did a relatively unknown priest from Argentina rise so quickly from obscurity to one of the top leaders of the twenty-first century?The answer lies in his humility, as well as the simple principles that have sprung from it. Lead with Humility explores 12 of these principles and shows how other leaders and managers across a broad spectrum can adapt them for the workplace with just as impressive results as our great pope has. These invaluable principles include: � Don't stand over your employees--sit down with them� Don't judge--assess� Take care of people, not lobbies� Go where you are needed� Temper ideology with pragmatism� Don't change--reinvent! � And more Even just a few years in, it is clear to all that Pope Francis's ability to inspire the world is unprecedented in modern times. Lead with Humility reveals the power of his methods, and helps anyone lead with the humility, grace, and authenticity that has elevated the pope to where he is today and had a direct impact in inspiring everyone and everything around him.</p><p><p> When <i>Fortune </i>announced its list of the World&#x2019;s Greatest Leaders, the top spot was awarded&#x2014;not to a captain of industry&#x2014;but to the new pontiff. </p> <p> </p> <p> In the year since his election, Pope Francis earned that accolade...and more.

But Pope Francis's strength emanates directly from his humility. </p> <p> Driving around Rome in a Ford Focus, rejecting the opulent papal quarters, ministering to the poor--these gestures demonstrate a type of leadership that many figured had long since been abandoned. They've made the pope the most talked about person on the planet, the most well-regarded reli�gious figure, and a moral and humanitarian leader to most, regardless of their faith. </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>Lead with Humility</i> shows how you can be as compassionate, authentic, and effective as this groundbreaking leader.

This is an invitation--a powerful and provocative call-to-action--to academic theologians to the work of social activism through movement building. <em>Activist Theology</em> summons all to take up radical acts of labor that uses scholarship and contemplation to build bridges with difference and make connections of solidarity, rooted in collective action. Featuring poetry by Brittini "Ree Belle" Gray, this rich and interdisciplinary work draws on continental philosophy, queer theology, and critical class theory in accessible and artful ways, using story, personal narratives, and sharp cultural analysis to bring clarity to the methods, sources, and objectives of activist theology. This is a key step forward in the contemporary conversation about theology and social action and will be essential reading for all those who want to see theology and ethics break new ground in the work of justice, hope, and liberation for all.</p></p><p><p><b>Robyn Henderson-Espinoza</b> is a theologian and ethicist based in Nashville, TN. They work in the hybrid spaces of the church, the academy, and movements for justice. They are also the founder of the Activist Theology Project, a collaborative project that uses media, art, advocacy, and story-telling as the primary forms of public theology and ethics.</p><p>"Henderson-Espinoza reminds us that radical social change requires truth drawn from the depths of both theology and the stories of everyday life. <em>Activist Theology</em> is a challenge to us all that invites us to reveal our own stories, deeply engage our collective wisdom, and, above all, do more than talk of revolution and actually participate in its happening." --Jennifer Knapp, singer/songwriter; founder Inside Out Faith; author of <em>Facing the Music</em></p> <p>"In a world beset by interlocking supremacies -- including white, Christian, rich, straight, cisgendered, and wealthy -- Robyn Henderson-Espinoza announces a theology that lives out loud in the streets and expresses itself in day-to-day life, bridging radical difference not with mere tolerance or inclusion but with revolutionary love. Appropriately, the book climaxes in poetry by Ree Belle, because prose alone cannot adequately convey this urgent invitation to join in the 'palpitation' of the world for justice, joy, and peace." --Brian D. McLaren, author/speaker/activist</p> <p>"Robyn Henderson-Espinoza embodies a theology that has transgressed the restricted boundaries of the academy, church, and the movement. <em>Activist Theology</em> is written for those who know deep in their gut that theology must be reborn, and that in its afterlife it must take seriously the impact of its lived ethics in the way of Jesus. It reminds us that faith without works is dead." --Drew G. I. Hart, Messiah College; author of <em>Trouble I've Seen: Changing the Way the Church Views Racism</em></p> <p>&#x201c;<em>Activist Theology</em> is the book I desperately wish I had been able to read ten years ago. As an academic, Henderson-Espinoza has made this inspiring work accessible and yet still very challenging. They are not just calling us to a new way to think but to a new way to live. <em>Activist Theology</em> is a guidebook to sparking new conversations and practices. At the same time, it is a memoir and insight into Henderson-Espinoza's story, helping us reflect upon on our stories. I'm so honored to do life alongside this human as well as utilize their work as a catalyst and resource for my own work. This is what <em>Activist Theology</em> invites us all to do." --Melissa Greene, teacher; cofounder of IMAGINARIUM</p> <p>"With passion and intimacy rarely found in theological thought, Robyn Henderson-Espinoza's <em>Activist Theology</em> is a profound delight, a gutsy proclamation of justice and freedom. Building on their own personal narrative and love for less-conventional God constructs, Henderson-Espinoza promotes a forward-thinking dogma, one that puts marginalized people groups at the forefront. They don't simply sing hope for forgotten communities, they offer creative and practical ways to inspire liberation, build bridges, and shine unapologetic light on all of the sins that define mainstream theologies and cultures." --Matthew Paul Turner, author of <em>Our Great Big American God and Churched</em></p> <p>"Jesus resisted a religion that served as chaplain to the empire. Karl Marx insisted a philosophy must not end at description but genuine change. Henderson-Espinoza demands a theological exile until religion returns to the streets. In <em>Activist Theology</em>, you get a full-throated and enfleshed vision of a theology worth living. We know that a beautiful memoir can move us. A fiery sermon can inspire us. A brilliant vision can seduce us. Activist Theology is all three and more. Henderson-Espinoza has written a book I didn't know I needed. Tell them 'thank you' in advance and get it today." --Tripp Fuller, creator and host of Homebrewed Christianity podcast</p></p><h2>Summer Crossing: A Novel (Modern Library Paperbacks)</h2><p>Thought to be lost for over 50 years, here is the first novel by one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. <br><br>Set in New York during the summer of 1945, this is the story of a young carefree socialite, Grady, who must make serious decisions about the romance she is dangerously pursuing and the effect it will have on everyone involved.<br><br>Fans of <b>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</b><i> </i>and Capote&#x2019;s short stories will be thrilled to read <b>Summer Crossing</b>.</p><p>Truman Capote was a native of New Orleans, where he was born on September 30, 1924. His first novel, <b>Other Voices, Other Rooms</b>, was an international literary success when first published in 1948, and accorded the author a prominent place among the writers of America's postwar generation. He sustained this position subsequently with short-story collections (<b>A Tree of Night</b>, among others), novels and novellas (<b>The Grass Harp</b> and <b>Breakfast at Tiffany's</b>), some of the best travel writing of our time (<b>Local Color</b>), profiles and reportage that appeared originally in <b>The New Yorker</b> (<b>The Duke in His Domain</b> and <b>The Muses Are Heard</b>), a true-crime masterpiece (<b>In Cold Blood</b>), several short memiors about his childhood in the South (<b>A Christmas Memory, The Thanksgiving Visitor, and One Christmas</b>), two plays (<b>The Grass Harp</b> and <b>House of Flowers</b> and two films (<b>Beat the devil</b> and <b>The Innocents</b>).<br><br>Mr. Capote twice won the O.Henry Memorial Short Story Prize and was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He died in August 1984, shortly before his sixtieth birthday.Chapter 1<br><br> &#x201c;You are a mystery, my dear,&#x201d; her mother said, and Grady, gazing across the table through a centerpiece of roses and fern, smiled indulgently: yes, I am a mystery, and it pleased her to think so. But Apple, eight years older, married, far from mysterious, said: &#x201c;Grady is only foolish; I wish I were going with you. Imagine, Mama, this time next week you&#x2019;ll be having breakfast in Paris! George keeps promising that we&#x2019;ll go . . . I don&#x2019;t know, though.&#x201d; She paused and looked at her sister. &#x201c;Grady, why on earth do you want to stay in New York in the dead of summer?&#x201d; Grady wished they would leave her alone; still this harping, and here now was the very morning the boat sailed: what was there to say beyond what she&#x2019;d said? After that there was only the truth, and the truth she did not entirely intend to tell. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never spent a summer here,&#x201d; she said, escaping their eyes and looking out the window: the dazzle of traffic heightened the June morning quiet of Central Park, and the sun, full of first summer, that dries the green crust of spring, plunged through the trees fronting the Plaza, where they were breakfasting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m perverse; have it your own way.&#x201d; She realized with a smile it was perhaps a mistake to have said that: her family did come rather near thinking her perverse; and once when she was fourteen she&#x2019;d had a terrible and quite acute insight: her mother, she saw, loved her without really liking her; she had thought at first that this was because her mother considered her plainer, more obstinate, less playful than Apple, but later, when it was apparent, and painfully so to Apple, that Grady was finer looking by far, then she gave up reasoning about her mother&#x2019;s viewpoint: the answer of course, and at last she saw this too, was simply that in an inactive sort of way, she&#x2019;d never, not even as a very small girl, much liked her mother. Yet there was little flamboyancy in either attitude; indeed, the house of their hostility was modestly furnished with affection, which Mrs. McNeil now expressed by closing her daughter&#x2019;s hand in her own and saying: &#x201c;We will worry about you, darling. We can&#x2019;t help that. I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s safe. Seventeen isn&#x2019;t very old, and you&#x2019;ve never been really alone before.&#x201d;<br><br> Mr. McNeil, who whenever he spoke sounded as though he was bidding in a poker game, but who seldom spoke in any event, partly because his wife did not like to be interrupted and partly because he was a very tired man, dunked out a cigar in his coffee cup, causing both Apple and Mrs. McNeil to wince, and said: &#x201c;When I was eighteen, why hell, I&#x2019;d been out in California three years.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But after all, Lamont . . . you&#x2019;re a man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d; he grunted. &#x201c;There has been no difference between men and women for some while. You say so yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> As though the conversation had taken an unpleasant turn, Mrs. McNeil cleared her throat. &#x201c;It remains, Lamont, that I am very uneasy in leaving&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Rising inside Grady was an ungovernable laughter, a joyous agitation which made the white summer stretching before her seem like an unrolling canvas on which she might draw those first rude pure strokes that are free. Then, too, and with a straight face, she was laughing because there was so little they suspected, nothing. The light quivering against the table silver seemed to at once encourage her excitement and to flash a warning signal: careful, dear. But elsewhere something said Grady, be proud, you are tall so fly your pennant high above and in the wind. What could have spoken, the rose? Roses speak, they are the hearts of wisdom, she&#x2019;d read so somewhere. She looked out the window again; the laughter was flowing up, it was flooding on her lips: what a sparkling sun-slapped day for Grady McNeil and roses that speak!<br><br> &#x201c;Why is that so funny, Grady?&#x201d; Apple did not have a pleasant voice; it suggested the subvocal prattlings of an ill-natured baby. &#x201c;Mother asks a simple question, and you laugh as though she were an idiot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Grady doesn&#x2019;t think me an idiot, surely not,&#x201d; said Mrs. McNeil, but a tone of weak conviction indicated doubt, and her eyes, webbed by the spidery hat-veil she now lowered over her face, were dimly confused with the sting she always felt when confronted by what she considered Grady&#x2019;s contempt. It was all very well that between them there should be only the thinnest contact: there was no real sympathy, she knew that; still, that Grady by her remoteness could suggest herself superior was unendurable: in such moments Mrs.<br><br> McNeil&#x2019;s hands twitched. Once, but this had been a great many years ago and when Grady was still a tomboy with chopped hair and scaly knees, she had not been able to control them, her hands, and on that occasion, which of course was during that period which is the most nervously trying of a woman&#x2019;s life, she had, provoked by Grady&#x2019;s inconsiderate aloofness, slapped her daughter fiercely. Whenever she&#x2019;d known afterwards similar impulses she steadied her hands on some solid surface, for, at the time of her previous unrestraint, Grady, whose green estimating eyes were like scraps of sea, had stared her down, had stared through her and turned a searchlight on the spoiled mirror of her vanities: because she was a limited woman, it was her first experience with a will-power harder than her own. &#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; she said, twinkling with artificial humor.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; said Grady. &#x201c;Did you ask a question? I never seem to hear anymore.&#x201d; She intended the last not so much as an apology as a serious confession.<br><br> &#x201c;Really,&#x201d; twittered Apple, &#x201c;one would think you were in love.&#x201d;<br><br> There was a knocking at her heart, a sense of danger, the silver shook momentously, and a lemon-wheel, half-squeezed in Grady&#x2019;s finger, paused still: she glanced swiftly into her sister&#x2019;s eyes to see if anything were there that was more shrewd than stupid. Satisfied, she finished squeezing the lemon into her tea and heard her mother say: &#x201c;It is about the dress, dear. I think I may as well have it made in Paris: Dior or Fath, someone like that. It might even be less expensive in the long run. A soft leaf green would be heaven, especially with your coloring and hair&#x2014;though I must say I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t cut it so short: it seems unsuitable and not&#x2014;not quite feminine. A pity debutantes can&#x2019;t wear green. Now I think something in white watered silk&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Grady interrupted her with a frown. &#x201c;If this is the party dress, I don&#x2019;t want it. I don&#x2019;t want a party, and I don&#x2019;t intend to go to any, not those kind at any rate. I will not be made a fool.&#x201d;<br><br> Of all the things that fatigued her, this tried and annoyed Mrs. McNeil most: she trembled as if unnatural vibrations jarred the sane and stable precincts of the Plaza dining-room. Nor do I mean to be made a fool, she might have said, for, in contemplating the promotion of Grady&#x2019;s debut year, she&#x2019;d done already a great lot of work, maneuvering: there was even some idea of hiring a secretary. Furthermore, and in a self-righteous vein, she could have gone even so far as to say that the whole of her social life, every drab luncheon and tiresome tea (as in this light she would describe them), had been suffered only in order that her daughters receive a dazzling acceptance in the years of their dance. Lucy McNeil&#x2019;s own debut had been a famous and sentimental affair: her grandmother, a rightfully celebrated New Orleans beauty who had married South Carolina&#x2019;s Senator LaTrotta, presented Lucy and her two sisters en masse at a Camellia ball in Charleston in April of 1920; it was a presentation truly, for the three LaTrotta sisters were no more than schoolgirls whose social adventures had been heretofore conducted within the shackles of a church; so hungrily had Lucy whirled that night her feet for days had worn the bruises of this entrance into living, so hungrily had she kissed the Governor&#x2019;s son that her cheeks had flamed a month in remorseful shame, for her sisters&#x2014;spinsters then and spinsters still&#x2014;claimed kissing made babies: no, her grandmother said, hearing her teary confession, kissing does not make babies&#x2014;neither does it make ladies. Relieved, she continued through to a year of triumph; it was a triumph because she was pleasant to look at, not unbearable to listen to: vast advantages when you remember that this was the meager season when the junior assembly had only such deplorable persimmons to choose among as Hazel Veere Numland or the Lincoln girls. Then, too, during the winter holidays, her mother&#x2019;s family, they were the Fairmonts from New York, had given in her honor, and in this very hotel, the Plaza, a distinguished dance; even though she sat now so near the scene, and was trying to recall, there was little about it she could remember, except that it was all gold and white, that she&#x2019;d worn her mother&#x2019;s pearls, and, oh yes, she&#x2019;d met Lamont McNeil, an unremarkable event: she danced with him once and thought nothing of it. Her mother, however, was more impressed, for Lamont McNeil, while socially unknown, and though still in his late twenties, cast over Wall Street an ever enlarging shadow, and so was considered a catch, if not in the circle of angels, then by those of a but slightly lower stratum. He was asked to dinner. Lucy&#x2019;s father invited him to South Carolina for the duck-shoot. Manly, old grand Mrs. LaTrotta commented, and, as this was her criterion, she gave him the golden seal. Seven months later Lamont McNeil, pitching his poker voice to its tenderest tremor, spoke his piece, and Lucy, having received only two other proposals, one absurd and the second a jest, said oh Lamont I&#x2019;m the happiest girl in the world. She was nineteen when she had her first child: Apple, so named, amusingly enough, because during her pregnancy Lucy McNeil had eaten them by the barrel, but her grandmother, appearing at the christening, thought it a shocking bit of frivolity&#x2014;jazz and the twenties, she said, had gone to Lucy&#x2019;s head. But this choice of name was the last gay exclamation point to a protracted childhood, for a year later she lost her second baby; stillborn, it was a son, and she called him Grady in memory of her brother killed in the war. She brooded a long while, Lamont hired a yacht and they cruised the Mediterranean; at every bright pastel port, from St. Tropez to Taormina, she gave on board sad weeping ice-cream parties for gangs of embarrassed native boys the steward shanghaied from ashore. But on their return to America, this tearful mist abruptly lifted: she discovered the Red Cross, Harlem, the two-demand bid, she took a professional interest in Trinity Church, the Cosmopolitan, the Republican Party, there was nothing she would not sponsor, contribute to, connive for: some said she was admirable, others said brave, a few despised her. They made a spirited clique, however, these few, and over the years their combined strength had sabotaged a dozen of her ambitions. Lucy had waited; she had waited for Apple: the mother of a topflight debutante has at her hands a social version of atomic revenge; but then she was cheated out of it, for there was the new war, and the poor taste of a debut in wartime would have been excessive: they had instead given an ambulance to England. And now Grady was trying to cheat her, too. Her hands twitted on the table, flew to the lapel of her suit, plucked at a brooch of cinnamon diamonds: it was too much, Grady had tried always to cheat her, just simply by not having been born a boy. She&#x2019;d named her Grady anyway, and poor Mrs. LaTrotta, then in the last exasperated year of her life, had roused herself sufficiently to declare Lucy morbid. But Grady had never been Grady, not the child she wanted. And it was not that in this matter Grady wanted to be ideal: Apple, with her pretty playful ways and aided by Lucy&#x2019;s sense of style, would have been an assured success, but Grady, who, for one thing, seemed not popular with young people, was a gambling chance. If she refused to cooperate, failure was certain. &#x201c;There will be a debut, Grady McNeil,&#x201d; she said, stretching her gloves. &#x201c;You will wear white silk and carry a bouquet of green orchids: it will catch a little the color of your eyes and your red hair. And we will have that orchestra the Bells had for Harriet. I warn you now, Grady, if you behave rottenly about this I shall never speak to you again. Lamont, will you ask for the check, please?&#x201d;<br><br> Grady was silent some moments; she knew the others were not as calm as they seemed: they were waiting again for her to act up, which proved with what inaccuracy they observed her, how unaware they were of her recent nature. A month ago, two months ago, if she had felt her dignity so intruded upon, she would have rushed out and roared her car onto the port road with the pedal flat on the floor; she would have found Peter Bell and cut the mischief in some highway tavern; she would have made them worry. But what she felt now was a genuine disinvolvement. And to some extent a sympathy with Lucy&#x2019;s ambitions. It was so far off, a summer away; there was no reason to believe it would ever happen, a white silk dress, and the orchestra the Bells had had for Harriet. While Mr. McNeil paid the check, and as they crossed the dining-room, she held Lucy&#x2019;s arm and with a coltish awkwardness gave her cheek a delicate spontaneous peck. It was a gesture that had the sudden effect of unifying them all; they were a family: Lucy glowed, her husband, her daughters, she was a proud woman, and Grady, for all her stubborn oddness was, let anyone say whatever they would, a wonderful child, a real person. &#x201c;Darling,&#x201d; Lucy said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to miss you.&#x201d;<br><br> Apple, who was walking ahead, turned around. &#x201c;Did you drive your car in this morning, Grady?&#x201d;<br><br> Grady was slow in answering; lately everything Apple said seemed suspicious; why care, really? What if Apple did know? Still, she did not want her to. &#x201c;I took the train from Greenwich.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then you left the car at home?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why, does it make any difference?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No; well, yes. And you needn&#x2019;t bark at me. I only thought you could drive me out on the Island. I promised George I&#x2019;d stop by the apartment and pick up his encyclopedia&#x2014;such a heavy thing. I&#x2019;d hate to carry it on the train. If we got there early enough you could go swimming.&#x201d;</p><h2>Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Melville&#x2019;s continuing adventures in the South Seas</b><p>Following the commercial and critical success of <i>Typee</i>, Herman Melville continued his series of South Sea adventure-romances with <i>Omoo</i>.

Only twelve when his father died bankrupt, young Herman tried work as a bank clerk, as a cabin-boy on a trip to Liverpool, and as an elementary schoolteacher, before shipping in January 1841 on the whaler Acushnet, bound for the Pacific. Deserting ship the following year in the Marquesas, he made his way to Tahiti and Honolulu, returning as ordinary seaman on the frigate United States to Boston, where he was discharged in October 1844. Books based on these adventures won him immediate success. By 1850 he was married, had acquired a farm near Pittsfield, Massachussetts (where he was the impetuous friend and neighbor of Nathaniel Hawthorne), and was hard at work on his masterpiece <b>Moby-Dick.</b><p>Literary success soon faded; his complexity increasingly alienated readers. After a visit to the Holy Land in January 1857, he turned from writing prose fiction to poetry. In 1863, during the Civil War, he moved back to New York City, where from 1866-1885 he was a deputy inspector in the Custom House, and where, in 1891, he died. A draft of a final prose work, <b>Billy Budd, Sailor</b>, was left unfinished and uncollated, packed&nbsp;tidily away by his widow, where it remained until its rediscovery and publication in 1924.</p></p><h2>Rebuilding the Foodshed: How to Create Local, Sustainable, and Secure Food Systems (Community Resilience Guide) (Community Resilience Guides)</h2><p>Droves of people have turned to local food as a way to retreat from our broken industrial food system. From rural outposts to city streets, they are sowing, growing, selling, and eating food produced close to home--and they are crying out for agricultural reform. All this has made &#34;local food&#34; into everything from a movement buzzword to the newest darling of food trendsters.But now it&#39;s time to take the conversation to the next level. That&#39;s exactly what Philip Ackerman-Leist does in &#34;Rebuilding the Foodshed,&#34; in which he refocuses the local-food lens on the broad issue of rebuilding regional food systems that can replace the destructive aspects of industrial agriculture, meet food demands affordably and sustainably, and be resilient enough to endure potentially rough times ahead.Changing our foodscapes raises a host of questions. How far away is local? How do you decide the size and geography of a regional foodshed? How do you tackle tough issues that plague food systems large and small--issues like inefficient transportation, high energy demands, and rampant food waste? How do you grow what you need with minimum environmental impact? And how do you create a foodshed that&#39;s resilient enough if fuel grows scarce, weather gets more severe, and traditional supply chains are hampered?Showcasing some of the most promising, replicable models for growing, processing, and distributing sustainably grown food, this book points the reader toward the next stages of the food revolution. It also covers the full landscape of the burgeoning local-food movement, from rural to suburban to urban, and from backyard gardens to large-scale food enterprises.</p><p><p>"The future of food is local. But how do we transition from our current globalized, supermarket-centered food world to one that's human-scaled and ecosystem-friendly? This book shows how communities across America are reclaiming the ability to feed themselves. It's inspiring as well as informative. If you eat, you really should read it."<strong>--Richard Heinberg, author of <em>The End of Growth</em> and <em>Peak Everything</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Choice-</strong></em></p> <p>"The third volume in the Community Resilience Guide series, this book explores themes similar to those in Michael Bryan's <em>Food Security</em> and Paul Roberts's <em>The End of Food</em>. Just as Michael Carolan recognizes in <em>The Real Cost of Cheap Food</em>, Ackerman-Leist (environmental studies, Green Mountain College) acknowledges the complex, confusing issues associated with local food, without detracting from its counterpoints. Much of Ackerman-Leist's argument focuses on how a locavore approach is articulated within a larger food production cycle. The book is divided into three sections. Part 1, 'Dilemmas, ' presents several questions related to the meaning of local food. Sections titled 'Drivers for Rebuilding Local Food Systems' and 'New Directions' follow. 'Drivers' provides excellent discussions of energy and the environment and a fresh look at the implications of food security and food justice, addressing topics such as equitable access, agricultural workers, and different agricultural commodities. The concluding section examines sometimes neglected areas, including current agricultural education or the role of incubator farms, before expanding the concept of local food into community-based food. Ackerman-Leist's task is not simple, but his approach is stimulating and worthwhile. Summing Up: Recommended."</p><br><br><p>"Now that it's not just acceptable but fashionable to write about local food systems, lots of people do it. Few pay close attention, however, as Ackerman-Leist does in this volume, to the variously shaped components successful local systems will require and the multiple efforts around the country working to create them. A wise, informed, and thoroughly useful book."<strong>--Joan Gussow, author of <em>Growing, Older</em> and <em>This Organic Life</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Phillip Ackerman-Leist has been in the trenches of food-systems change for well over a decade, from farm to school. Now he has elegantly laid out the principles of how to redesign foodsheds for greater food security, justice, and energy efficiency, while engaging communities in making tangible innovations on the ground. He is undoubtedly in the best place to address these issues, since Vermont communities have accomplished more food relocalization than those in any other state."--<strong>Gary Paul Nabhan, pioneer in the food relocalization movement, author of <em>Coming Home to Eat</em> and </strong><em><strong>Renewing America's Food Traditions</strong> <br> </em></p><br><br><p>"By now we have all learned that local food is about much more than food miles. Philip Ackerman-Leist has eloquently helped us to understand just how comprehensive the concept is: how our food system must be redesigned if it is to be reliable and resilient, how that design must be guided by principles of ecology, justice, health, and humility, and how to put such theories into practice for farmers, chefs, consumers, and communities. A practical guide for anyone interested in imagining our food systems of the future."<strong>--Frederick Kirschenmann, author of <em>Cultivating an Ecological Conscience: Essays from a Farmer/Philosopher</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em>"Rebuilding the Foodshed </em>introduces readers to local food systems in all their complexities. In moving from industrial to regional food systems, communities must consider an enormous range of factors, from geographic to socioeconomic. Difficult as doing this may be, this book makes it clear that the results are well worth the effort in their benefits to farmers and farm workers as well as eaters."<strong>--Marion Nestle, professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University and author of <em>What to Eat</em> </strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>ForeWord</em></strong><strong><em> Reviews-</em></strong></p> <p>From the Acknowledgements section on, Philip Ackerman-Leist's newest book is highly enjoyable, sincere, and informative. An associate professor at Vermont's Green Mountain College, Ackerman-Leist heads up the Farm and Food Project at the college and has years of experience in homesteading. So, when he asks questions about sustainable and local food, it is from a deeply personal perspective. Readers will appreciate the well-researched arguments and examples, as well as the academician behind them.<br> <br> Ackerman-Leist embarks on a personal challenge to define these buzzword categories of "local" and "sustainable." He exhaustively tackles all of the logistics of creating a truly local food system as he engages and entertains readers. Key to Ackerman-Leist's goals is engaging more members of the community in local food initiatives. Addressing the growing problem of food insecurity as it relates to underutilized or lack of local food systems, as well as taking on the food justice issue, must be priorities for concerned locavores. In searching for answers, he highlights several groundbreaking citizen/producer-owned programs as well as problematic status quo operations. Getting healthy food into the hands of all people requires that we pull the elitist label off of anyone who has an interest in healthy, local food. The author's writing style entirely succeeds in making an academic line of questioning feel fun, relevant, and accessible to all who are interested.<br> <br> Ultimately, this is a great book that will catapult readers into a highly critical understanding of the many complex issues with food and localized agriculture in the United States, as well as offer possible solutions. Ackerman-Leist writes with lively panache, an unlikely but somehow well-suited style for talk of such serious problems. This book is highly recommended for anyone who hopes to be part of the evolution.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em><br> For a somewhat wonky book about food policy, <em>Rebuilding the Foodshed</em> is unusually humorous and open-minded. Vermont farmer and professor Ackerman-Leist ruminates his way through the conundrums and possibilities of local food, demonstrating how words and their definitions can shed light on and transform our understanding of the rapidly evolving, often confusing, emotion-fraught questions of what people eat, where the food comes from, who has access to what, and how the answers to these questions affect the lives of eaters and growers. Let's call food production farming, he suggests. "Farming is about energy flows. 'Food production' is about a terminal point in the act of agriculture." He finds solutions in the actions of pioneers of food production, distribution, and education, including D-Town Farm--a "step into transcendence" in a deteriorating Detroit suburb that recycles waste to grow vegetables and mushrooms, harvest honey, and help revitalize the devastated local economy. Ackerman-Leist also examines New North Florida Cooperative's farm-to-school program. With insight, he demonstrates how communities can bridge and transcend the "false divides" he pinpoints in the local-food conversation: urban/rural, small-scale/large-scale, local/international, and all/nothing.</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong></p> <p>In-depth scrutiny of the modern food system and suggestions on how it should change. Ackerman-Leist (<em>Up Tunket Road: The Education of a Modern Homesteader</em>, 2010) explores how to take food production and distribution away from the mega-corporations and place it in the hands of local communities and small farms. He analyzes energy consumption from the field to the refrigerator; the environment, with "the idea that a sustainable food system is one that begins and ends with the careful management of the foundation of it all: the soil"; and food security--i.e., how to ensure that everyone in the country has enough food to ward off hunger and malnutrition. The author also thoroughly investigates biodiversity of crops and conducts a study of "food systems that embrace a diversity of cultural and economic perspectives." Ackerman-Leist culminates his studies by exploring the latest techniques used to improve food production, such as high tunnels and greenhouses that extend growing seasons or the numerous microbreweries and cider houses that provide delicious products without high energy costs. The author's image of "local food" has morphed over time, just as the whole industry has changed: "The image that comes to mind these days is of dynamic, interlocking systems--a vast network of differently sized pulsing centerpoints connected to one other by means of surging flows that create exchanges of resources, ideas, and of course foods." Dense with information and studded with numerous graphs and charts, this book provides a deeper understanding of what principles need to change in order to create local food environments.</p>Philip Ackerman-Leist, author of Rebuilding the Foodshed and Up Tunket Road, is a professor at Green Mountain College, where he established the college's farm and sustainable agriculture curriculum and is director of the Green Mountain College Farm &amp; Food Project. He also founded and directs the college's Masters in Sustainable Food Systems (MSFS), the nation's first online graduate program in food systems, featuring applied comparative research of students' home bioregions. He and his wife, Erin, farmed in the South Tirol region of the Alps and North Carolina before beginning their sixteen-year homesteading and farming venture in Pawlet, Vermont. With more than two decades of "field experience" working on farms, in the classroom, and with regional food systems collaborators, Philip's work is focused on examining and reshaping local and regional food systems from the ground up.

Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world.

Rather than a comprehensive political or historical study of the region, <i>The Traveller&#x2019;s Tree</i>, Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s first book, gives us his own vivid, idiosyncratic impressions of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, Barbados, Trinidad, and Haiti, among other islands. Here we watch Leigh Fermor walk the dusty roads of the countryside and the broad avenues of former colonial capitals, equally at home among the peasant and the elite, the laborer and the artist. He listens&nbsp;to steel drum bands, delights in the Congo dancing that closes out Havana&#x2019;s Carnival, and observes vodou and Rastafarian rites, all with the generous curiosity and easy erudition that readers will recognize from his subsequent classic accounts <i>A Time of Gifts</i> and <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i>. <br></p><p><b>Patrick Leigh Fermor</b> (1915-2011) was an intrepid traveler, a heroic soldier, and a writer with a unique prose style. After his stormy schooldays, followed by the walk across Europe to Constantinople that begins in <i>A Time of Gifts</i> (1977) and continues through <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i> (1986), he lived and traveled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago. His books <i>Mani</i> (1958) and <i>Roumeli</i> (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. He lived partly in Greece&#x2014;in the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani&#x2014;and partly in Worcestershire. He was knighted in 2004 for his services to literature and to British&#x2013;Greek relations. <br><br> <b>Joshua Jelly-Schapiro</b> is a doctoral student in geography at the University of California, Berkeley. He has written for <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Believer</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Foreign Policy</i>, and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, among other publications.The Caribbean as Fermor experienced it in the 1940's was a world of incredible fusions and contradictions that didn't exist anywhere else in the world - the mix of indigenous, African and European cultures, the juxtaposition of American advertisements with ancient cannibal practices, the incredible richness of the natural environment coupled with the decaying state of the colonial cities. <p>Although Fermor had travelled extensively, he found the West Indies to be unlike anything he could have imagined, and each new experience is a surprise. This book is a pleasure to read, full of excitement and rich sensory experience, as well as beautifully written. Fermor's first view of the islands demonstrates the elegance of his language: </p><p>"To port, pale green islands were floating on the water, but the main body of Grande Terre...lay in shadow on the starboard side between us and the dawn. It was just possible to descry the waves of black vegetation and the lakes of mist entangled in the treetops where the country dipped. In the space of a few minutes the sunrise melted from violet into amber, from amber into scarlet, from scarlet into zinc and from zinc into saffron. The dark vegetation became a line of giant, pale green parsley, which hovered a hundred yards away in a fluttering cumulus that nothing appeared to tether to either land or sea." </p><p>Language, religion, costume, geography - the author inquires into everything, and because of this natural curiosity, he gets himself into some interesting, and often funny, situations, like being chased around the beach by a blindfolded man with a divining rod. Equally interesting, though, are his descriptions of the specific melding of cultures that has occurred exclusively in these islands: </p><p>"The afternoon was baking and shadowless, and the town seemed only with an effort to remain upright among its thoroughfares of dust. It was as empty as a sarcophagus. The French guide-book describes it as a great centre of elegant Creole life in the past, hinting at routs and cavalcades and banquets of unparalleled sumptuousness. Acts of God must have fallen upon it with really purposeful vindictiveness, for not by the most violent manhandling of the imagination could one associate a chandelier or a powdered wig with this collection of hovels. Not even a dog was to be seen. But behind a tall crucifix stood a cemetery of such dimensions - Pere Lachaise and the Campo Santo gone mad...These acres inhabited by the dead, these miniature hails and palaces and opera-houses, were, it occurred to me, the real town, and the houses falling to ruins outside the railings were in the nature of a negligible suburb." </p><p>He is generally respectful of the cultures he encounters, and describes the dining habits of cannibals without batting an eyelash: </p><p>"The victims were prepared while still alive, by cutting slits down the back and sides into which pimentos and other herbs were stuffed. After being dispatched with a mace, they were trussed to poles and roasted over a medium fire, while the women busied themselves turning and basting, and catching the lard in gourds and calabashes, which they allowed to set and then stored away. They would eagerly lick the sticks where the gravy had fallen. Often the meal was half roasted, and then half boiled. Some of the meat was eaten on the spot, the rest was cut up and smoked and also prudently put by for lean or unpatriotic periods in the future. But there was a symbolical aspect to these banquets. They were considered to seal a military victory, to put it for ever beyond question. De Rochefort reports that a Carib prisoner, while being made ready, would jeer at his captors, saying that, although they would soon be eating him, he had already swallowed so many of their family or tribe, and was so thoroughly nourished on their neighbours and kin, that they would virtually be eating one of their own people. This kind of language would continue until the final blow was delivered. It never failed to exasperate the company, and to cast an atmosphere of dejection over the whole meal." </p><p>That is the beauty of this narrative - it is just one tasty morsel after another.</p></p><h2>Green Arrow 2: Island of Scars</h2><p>The Emerald Archer's acclaimed relauch continues here in GREEN ARROW VOL. 2: ISLAND OF SCARS!<br><br>Green Arrow was victorious in crippling the Ninth Circle, but taking down the global criminal financial empire left Oliver and his allies bruised, broken, and scattered to the wind.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In Japan, Emiko Queen takes up her bow in defiance of her mother, the Yakuza assassin Shado, and goes into a supernatural underworld to win back her family&#x2019;s honor and freedom.

With confidence and sweeping aspirations, the Idealist philosophers Immanuel Kant, Johann Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and Georg Hegel set out to make metaphysics a science, to explore the nature of the self and man's role in society, to examine the essence of the natural world, and to develop a vision of world history and the progressive consciousness of man. In this masterful introduction to German Idealism, Rudiger Bubner brings together key texts and lesser known extracts from the works of these four powerful intellects, together with insightful overviews of each philosopher and an account of the movement as a whole.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Among the issues to be covered: <br><br>� To understand how a daughter's attachment to her mother&#x2014;more so than her relationship with her father&#x2014;colors all her other relationships, and to analyze why it is more difficult for daughters than sons to separate from their mothers, as well as why daughters are more subject than sons to a mother's manipulation<br>� To recognize the difference between a healthy and a destructive mother-daughter connection, and to define clearly the &#x201c;bad mommy,&#x201d; in order to help readers who have trouble acknowledging their childhood losses to begin to comprehend them<br>� To conjugate what I call the &#x201c;Bad Mommy Taboo&#x201d;&#x2014;why our culture is more eager to protect the sanctity of maternity than it is to protect emotionally abused daughters <br>� To describe the evolution of the "unpleasable" mother&#x2014;in all likelihood, she was bereft of maternal love as a child&#x2014;and to recognize the huge, and often poignant, stake she has in keeping her grown daughter dependent and off-balance<br>� To illustrate the consequent controlling behavior&#x2014;in some cases, cloaked in fragility or good intentions&#x2014;of such mothers, which falls into general patterns, including: the Doormat, the Critic, the Smotherer, the Avenger, the Deserter <br>� To understand that the daughter has a similar stake in either being a slave to or hating her mother&#x2014;the two sides of her depen dency and immaturity <br>� To illustrate the responsive behavior&#x2014;and survival mechanisms &#x2014;of daughters, which is determined in part by such variables as birth rank, family history, and temperament, and which also falls into patterns, including: the Angel, the Superachiever, the Cipher, the Troublemaker, the Defector <br>� To show how to redefine the mother-daughter relationship, so that each can learn to see and accept the other as she is today, appreciating each other's good qualities and not being snared by the bad<br>� Finally, to demonstrate that a redefined relationship with one's mother&#x2014;adult to adult&#x2014;frees you from the past, whether that re definition ultimately results in real friendship, affectionate truce, or divorce.</p><p><b>Victoria Secunda </b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>When You and Your Mother Can&#x2019;t Be Friends: Resolving the Most Complicated Relationship of Your Life</i>, <i>Women and Their Fathers: The Sexual and Romantic Impact of the First Man In Your Life</i>, and <i>Losing Your Parents, Finding Your Self: The Defining Turning Point of Adult Life</i>.<b> </b>Additionally, her writings have also appeared in <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar, Glamour, </i>and <i>Women&#x2019;s Day</i>.<b> </b>She lives in Connecticut.1<br> Natural Allies,<br> Natural Enemies<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always tried to be all the things my mother wanted me to be: ever the lady, always polite, never inconsiderate. I run my business the way my mother ran our house&#x2014;everything just so. In some ways I am my mother&#x2014;full of life when I&#x2019;m happy, very cold when I&#x2019;m angry. People say I look just like her.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ll tell you a secret: Every time I pass a mirror, I gasp.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wonder if there&#x2019;s more here than meets the eye.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Karen, thirty-nine<br> &nbsp;<br> Few comments strike as much terror in the female heart, or more rapidly raise a lovers&#x2019; tiff to the boiling point, than the comment &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting more like your mother every day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> You may love your mother. You may even like her. Nevertheless, there resides within each daughter the need to be different, to improve on the old model, to be a composite of all your own unique goodness and take total credit for it. Woven into the mother-daughter tie is a built-in and unavoidable tension that goes with the territory of being someone&#x2019;s child.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so the suggestion that you are your mother&#x2019;s clone cuts to the very heart of independence; it suggests not only that you are still a child and incapable of standing on your own but, worse, that you may be a composite only of her flaws&#x2014;all of which you know intimately and in excruciating detail.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the same time, there is a genetic booby trap in trying to carve out your identity when your mother shares much of that identity. For a daughter to withdraw entirely from her mother is to reject her role model, her mentor, her template; love-hate is the natural order of things&#x2014;we can separate, but only so far.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is for daughters a limit to how different from Mom we realistically can be because, damn it, in many ways we simply are like her, ways that we cannot change&#x2014;and when we&#x2019;re feeling good and able to see her as a whole person, might not even want to. <br> &nbsp;<br> Besides, who has known us longer than she has?<br> &nbsp;<br> The truth is, in moments of crisis or tearful self-doubt, we need her&#x2014;somehow, magically, we want to believe she is capable of making it all better, there, there. So we don&#x2019;t want to hurt her feelings and we don&#x2019;t want to risk her disapproval. On some level, rejecting Mama feels like shooting yourself in the foot.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet she can make us crazy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am standing in the sun-splashed kitchen of Martha, a friend since college, sipping a cup of coffee. While she is momentarily out of the room, her twenty-five-year-old daughter, Debby, visiting for the weekend, pads in for breakfast, her face shrouded in gloom. She pulls a mug from the cabinet, pours herself a cup of coffee, and says with a sigh,<br> &nbsp;<br> Mom sure is &#x201c;off&#x201d; today. Every time I ask her what&#x2019;s wrong, she says, &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve spent the whole morning making nice, wondering if she&#x2019;s mad at me. My brother&#x2019;s much smarter than me. He sees her in a snit, asks himself, &#x201c;Did I do something wrong?&#x201d; decides he didn&#x2019;t and that it&#x2019;s her problem, gives her a big kiss, and goes about his business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why can&#x2019;t I be like him? I know I didn&#x2019;t do anything, but still, I feel as if I did.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> We do, still, very much want our mothers to love us; indeed, our mood, even our well-being, often depends on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> So much so that we sometimes think we&#x2019;ve erred even when we haven&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> So much so that she can shatter our day with a single phrase: &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And she can do it, whether she is a saint or a monster.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like Mother, Like Daughter<br> &nbsp;<br> Mothers and daughters&#x2014;they are, as journalist Liz Smith puts it, &#x201c;natural allies [and] natural enemies.&#x201d; Loving your mother represents the best and the worst of times.<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember once remarking to my mother, when I was in elementary school, that a friend of the family reminded me of Miss Havisham in Dickens&#x2019;s Great Expectations.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very well put,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Set aside, if you will, the fact that I had plucked the analogy from something I had read because it sounded good to me, too. The fact is, I have never forgotten the compliment&#x2014;indeed, it was the moment at which my ambition to become a writer first began to take shape.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I have also never forgotten the time when, at sixteen and, no doubt, in high adolescent dudgeon, I disagreed with her in front of guests about something. My mother, as though struck, whirled around and snapped, &#x201c;Sit down in front of your elders and your betters.&#x201d; Even in decades-old recollection, the rebuke still stings, like a raw sunburn.<br> &nbsp;<br> No relationship is as highly charged as that between mother and daughter, or as riddled with expectations that could, like a land mine, detonate with a single misstep, a solitary stray word that, without warning, wounds or enrages. And no relationship is as bursting with possibilities of goodwill and understanding.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is it about the attachment that gives it such power? Why is it so different from the relationship between mothers and sons, or fathers and sons, for that matter?<br> &nbsp;<br> For one thing, there is no human being who is, literally, as similar to us&#x2014;indeed, mothers and daughters mirror each other right down to genes and sexual engineering. We may even look like her. Like mother, we have breasts, can bear children, and feminist revisionism notwithstanding, are usually our family&#x2019;s, or partner&#x2019;s, emotional caretaker. And like her, we are vulnerable to sexism and rape.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nor is any relationship as competitive: like Mother, we compete for Dad&#x2019;s attention. And, both spawned in female vanity, we are encouraged to be vain, vying for a favorable report from the mirror on the wall and the bathroom scale on the floor. We try to tailor ourselves to at least keep pace with her&#x2014;if not best her&#x2014;on the work path or in our choice of mates.<br> &nbsp;<br> She is the yardstick against which we measure ourselves: have we done &#x201c;it&#x201d;&#x2014;education, career, sexuality, marriage, thinness, popularity, chic, motherhood, the gentle arts of homemaking&#x2014;as well as she has? Better? Differently?<br> &nbsp;<br> Because if we have done &#x201c;it&#x201d; both well and differently, we are then prepared to survive without her. We have completed the course.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there&#x2019;s a hitch in the mother-daughter separation process: We want to survive, but not entirely without her. We want to detach, but not defect. Because, like it or not, we are still very much bound up with her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether our relationship is strained or easy, hostile or amiable, we need her, if only in memory or fantasy, to conjugate our history, validate our femaleness, and guide our way; we need to know she&#x2019;s there if we stumble, to love us no matter what, to nurture the child that resides within us even now without infantilizing us. It is a need that never leaves us in the best of mother-daughter attachments and, in the worst, yawns wider than the heart can bear.<br> &nbsp;<br> A mother sets the tone for her daughter&#x2019;s life, provides a road map and role model, continues through the daughter&#x2019;s middle and old age to be her example, particularly her genetic and emotional example. So we ask her: When did she menstruate? Begin menopause? How did she feel about and deal with love? Friendship? Work? Sexual longing? Loneliness?<br> &nbsp;<br> But if mother and daughter have no connection, we cannot ask the one person whose psyche and body have programmed our own. That&#x2019;s why the loss is incalculable when a daughter has to figure it out for herself, trailblaze rather than follow her mother&#x2019;s example or learn from it. Such a daughter has to discover herself, alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Women may define themselves ... in terms of their work roles, but the pull in the opposite direction, to merge blissfully and symbiotically with the mother, is as strong as ever,&#x201d; writes Dr. Jane B. Abramson in Mothermania: A Psychological Study of Mother-Daughter Conflict. &#x201c;It is inherent in the human condition.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That merging becomes evident in ways that are expected and very much conscious, as well as at the most unexpected and surprising moments.<br> &nbsp;<br> Joan is by any measure an independent, achieving woman. President of an advertising agency, she is the pride of her physician husband and her two grown sons, who adore her. She is invited to give speeches and to receive awards all over the country. But at forty-nine, Joan still calls her mother for advice at least once, sometimes twice, every day, no matter where she is. Says Joan,<br> &nbsp;<br> I can&#x2019;t be with my mother five minutes without wanting to kill her. And yet I really believe in my heart of hearts that I would be nothing without her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She has always said, &#x201c;In the end, no matter what happens&#x2014;you could murder, you could steal, you could be a disgrace&#x2014;no matter what happens only your mother really loves you. Your mother will never, never turn her back on you. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t trust anybody but your mother&#x201d; And I believe it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Every Day a Word Surprises Me &amp; Other Quotes by Writers</h2><p><p><strong>Advice, strong opinions, and personal revelations by the world's greatest writers - exclusively researched for this new book</strong></p><p>Featuring the most inspirational and insightful collection of quotes by writers through the ages and across the globe, <em>Every Day a Word Surprises Me</em> is the ideal keepsake for readers, writers, and everyone who appreciates the exquisite power of words.

In this new treatment of the subject, Hopkins focuses on the many debates surrounding these movements: the Marquis de Sade's Surrealist deification, issues of quality (How good is Dali?), the idea of the 'readymade', attitudes towards the city, the impact of Freud, attitudes to women, fetishism, and primitivism. The international nature of these movements is examined, covering the cities of Zurich, New York, Berlin, Cologne, Barcelona, Paris, London, and recently discovered examples in Eastern Europe.<br><br>Hopkins explores the huge range of media employed by both Dada and Surrealism (collage, painting, found objects, performance art, photography, film) , whilst at the same time establishing the aesthetic differences between the movements. He also examines the Dadaist obsession with the body-as-mechanism in relation to the Surrealists' return to the fetishized/eroticized body.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Hopkins</strong> is Professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Glasgow.

The ethical issues that arise from these developments extend beyond the boundaries of conventional bioethics into philosophy of mind, psychology, theology, public policy, and the law. This broader set of concerns is the subject matter of neuroethics. In this book, leading neuroscientist Martha Farah introduces the reader to the key issues of neuroethics, placing them in scientific and cultural context and presenting a carefully chosen set of essays, articles, and excerpts from longer works that explore specific problems in neuroethics from the perspectives of a diverse set of authors. Included are writings by such leading scientists, philosophers, and legal scholars as Carl Elliot, Joshua Greene, Steven Hyman, Peter Kramer, and Elizabeth Phelps. Topics include the ethical dilemmas of cognitive enhancement; issues of personality, memory and identity; the ability of brain imaging to both persuade and reveal; the legal implications of neuroscience; and the many ways in which neuroscience challenges our conception of what it means to be a person.</p><p><i>Neuroethics</i> is an essential guide to the most intellectually challenging and socially significant issues at the interface of neuroscience and society. Farah's clear writing and well-chosen readings will be appreciated by scientist and humanist alike, and the inclusion of questions for discussion in each section makes the book suitable for classroom use.</p><p><b>Contributors</b><br>Zenab Amin, Ofek Bar-Ilan, Richard G.

Updated and expanded to include the most current research on low back pain and its treatment, this easy-to-read guide provides readers with 'need to know' information about the spine, effectively taking the mystery out of back pain and its treatment. Based upon sound and current research, 'Spinal Stabilization' describes how the spine and its muscles are intended to work, and how this changes once back pain sets in. New to the second edition is a clear discussion of the critical differences between stabilization exercises used by people with back pain and those who want a more &#x201c;high-performance&#x201d;, athletic spine. This is a key area author Rick Jemmett felt compelled to address. "There is still a significant amount of confusion in the rehabilitation, fitness and sports conditioning professions as to what truly constitiutes therapeutic stabilization exercises. The better quality research is actually quite clear on this yet many people remain stuck on the idea that exercising on a ball will correct low back pain. Some low back pain patients might feel better temporarily with such programs, but we now have the ability to do so much more than this. Instead of simply reducing the symptoms for a short while, we have the ability to achieve a true correction of the problem." Spinal Stabilization, 2nd Edition is divided into two sections. The first describes in detail the scientifically proven Australian approach of therapeutic segmental stabilization exercise. Clear descriptions along with illustrations and photos give readers the tools they need to correctly perform these important exercises. The second section discusses the use of 'Integrated Training' in sport-specific conditioning programs. This involves the simultaneous training of the body's stability, balance and strength systems for maximum athletic performance.</p><p>My colleagues in the rehabilitation professions will recognize the concepts utilized in Spinal Stabilization - The New Science of Back Pain as having their origins in the clinical model developed by Carolyn Richardson, Paul Hodges, Julie Hides and Gwen Jull which of course was based on the basic sciences work of Panjabi, Vleeming, Gertzbein, McGill, Solomonow and others. As we are all too well aware, evidence-based treatment models are few and far between thus it has been a pleasure to develop this book for our patients with spinal pathology. <p>The book expands somewhat on the Australian model by incorporating axial proprioception training as an integral component. I feel this is warranted in that motor control cannot possibly be improved without accurate proprioceptive feedback, and what we are really doing of course with these patients is motor re-training in light of the inhibition of multifidus which has been so well demonstrated in the literature. </p> <p>I feel confident that the book does an excellent job of presenting the segmental stabilization approach in a clear, understandable and accurate manner. I hope you find this to be a useful patient education tool - I welcome and look forward to your comments and suggestions for future editions.</p>Rick Jemmett, B.Sc., (PT), a graduate of the University of Toronto&#x2019;s Physical Therapy program, has lived and practiced in Halifax, Nova Scotia since 1994. My clinical work as a physical therapist at Maritime Physiotherapy involves the diagnosis and treatment of people with various forms of neuromusculoskeletal pathology. Our facility treats a wide range of patients including people with sport and work related conditions. I have also lectured and taught courses for physiotherapists, physicians, kinesiologists and physiotherapy assistants across Canada and the United States through the Atlantic Manual Therapy Institute. My primary area of clinical interest centres on the rehabilitation and prevention of spinal and shoulder instability. Throughout my career I have maintained a keen interest in the basic sciences of anatomy and motor control. My research interests involve the neuromuscular aspects of spinal stability in both healthy and back-injured people. I have also had the good fortune to work with various athletes, both recreational and competitive, developing their sport specific conditioning programs. My own participation in sports currently includes playing golf, running and skiing along with an ongoing attempt to maintain a regular training regime, including spinal stabilization exercises. My personal sports injury history includes two dislocated shoulders, a dislocated IP joint (thanks to colleague Mike Ritchie for getting that back in place) an unstable lumbar spinal joint (again, thanks to Mike Ritchie for his expert assistance on this one), sacroiliac joint dysfunction, ITB friction syndrome, a golf-related stress fracture of a rib, a broken toe and occasional plantarfasciitis. This is mentioned only to reassure readers that physical therapists bang themselves up as frequently as you do, and that we do know what it is like to be injured and unable to participate in all life&#x2019;s activities. The information presented in this book may have been developed in the scientific world, but it has been proven in the real world - I have witnessed the positive results both as a clinician and as a patient.</p><h2>Hitman: Enemy Within: A Novel</h2><p><b>The clone assassin has been played long enough&#x2014;now it&#x2019;s more than a game.</b><br><br> Bred to kill, Agent 47 is The Agency&#x2019;s most valuable assassin.

The air smelled sweet and sunlight glittered like gold on the water as heavily laden boats churned past, headed in both directions. Many of the river craft were owned by families who lived on board, evidence of which could be seen in the playpens that occupied what little deck space there was and the gaily colored laundry that fluttered from lines rigged for that purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was an idyllic scene, and for one brief moment the international shipping magnate wished he were down there, standing behind the wheel of a heavily loaded freighter headed for Basel or Amsterdam. Such a life would be simpler, and in some ways more enjoyable, than the one he was living. His was a high-profile existence in which he was forever doomed to walk the slippery slopes of international finance while trying to protect both his lifestyle and the business empire founded by his grandfather.<br> &nbsp;<br> But sweet though the river life might appear from a hundred feet above, Thorakis knew how hard such an existence could be, and had no desire to give up the luxuries to which he and his family were accustomed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A penny for your thoughts,&#x201d; Pierre Douay said as he appeared at the Greek&#x2019;s elbow. The approach had been silent, notably so, and Thorakis gave an involuntary start.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful day,&#x201d; the shipping magnate replied neutrally.<br> &nbsp;<br> Douay nodded. The castle was the Frenchman&#x2019;s, and though Thorakis had inherited his wealth, he knew that Douay was a self-made man. Wealthy though the Greek was, it was he who had come begging, and Douay who would decide the shipping magnate&#x2019;s fate.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you think of it?&#x201d; Douay inquired, as the other man took his first sip of the chilled Riesling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dry,&#x201d; Thorakis observed, &#x201c;and crisp. Which is to say perfect for a day such as this.&#x201d; The fifty-two-year-old business tycoon had black hair streaked with gray, and a tight, &#x201c;sculptured&#x201d; face. Though he had been something of an amateur athlete in his younger days, the Greek had put on some extra pounds over the last few years&#x2014;weight that a baggy black shirt was unable to conceal. Khaki pants and a pair of Gucci loafers, sans socks, completed the look.<br> &nbsp;<br> Douay, by contrast, was ten years younger, rapier thin, and in excellent shape. With the exception of a thin black leather belt and the black sandals on his feet, the Frenchman was dressed entirely in white.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you like it,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;It comes from the Moselle valley, rather than the Rhine. It&#x2019;s the slaty soil that makes the difference.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thorakis had no idea what that meant, nor did he care, but didn&#x2019;t say so as he sought a way to open the conversation that both men knew was coming.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Some years are better than others,&#x201d; the Greek observed thoughtfully. &#x201c;For wine and for shipping.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Douay agreed soberly. &#x201c;Who could have predicted that one of your tankers would run aground off Portugal, that a cruise liner would be lost to pirates, and that your CFO would be arrested? All in less than a year? It defies imagination! Come. Lunch is ready and we will have plenty of opportunity to talk about wine, women, and shipping.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A linen-covered table had been set in the shade provided by a large canopy made out of blue and white striped canvas. The canopy rustled gently as a breeze blew down the Rhine and caressed the castle&#x2019;s stone walls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thorakis studied the table carefully. Though frequently given to excess where food was concerned, he had a severe allergy, and was therefore particular about what he ate. That was why a personal chef prepared most of the Greek&#x2019;s meals when he was home, accompanied the shipping magnate wherever he went, and stood guard in the kitchen when Thorakis ate in restaurants. Having noted that the sleek-looking chef was there, standing a discreet distance away, the businessman knew the food would be safe as he took the chair opposite Douay.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To a long and profitable relationship,&#x201d; the Frenchman said as he raised his glass. Yet rather than the bonhomie he might have expected to see in Douay&#x2019;s eyes, Thorakis saw something else instead. Something hard and calculating.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the Greek agreed, raising his own glass of Riesling. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to a long and profitable relationship.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The glasses made a gentle clinking sound as they met, and there was a brief flurry of activity as Douay&#x2019;s servants hurried to serve the food. The first course consisted of chilled shrimp served on a bed of leafy greens and accompanied by a basket of crusty bread.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rather than toying with Thorakis, Douay went right to the point. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the Frenchman began, as he buttered a piece of bread. &#x201c;I hope you won&#x2019;t be offended by my directness...but how much money would be required to take care of your present difficulties?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Though surprised by the other man&#x2019;s bluntness, Thorakis was pleased, since he had been unsure of how to open the negotiations. He swallowed a bite of shrimp, chased it with a sip of wine, and dabbed his lips with a napkin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;About 500 million euros would see us through. A secured loan mind you, with a five-year term.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of money,&#x201d; Douay observed mildly. &#x201c;But not too much, so long as the collateral is sufficient.&#x201d; He paused, and looked directly at his guest as he added, &#x201c;And if you&#x2019;re willing to provide me with certain kinds of information.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The first requirement was to be expected, but the second was unusual, and caused Thorakis to frown. &#x201c;Information? I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really quite simple,&#x201d; the Frenchman replied, as he speared a shrimp. &#x201c;You sit on the board of directors for an organization known as The Agency. I have a similar relationship with a group you know as the Puissance Treize&#x2014;or the Power Thirteen. As you are probably aware, the Puissance Treize has begun to challenge The Agency both in terms of market share and gross revenues. Nevertheless, a gap remains, at least for the moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But with certain key information, supplied by you, it might be possible for our brand to dominate the market within months, rather than years.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly the freshly baked bread seemed excessively dry, and Thorakis needed a mouthful of wine to wash it down.<br> &nbsp;<br> His affiliation with The Agency centered around problems related to transport and logistics, and was supposed to be a secret. Yet Douay knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Blood pounded in his temples and he felt the sudden need to urinate.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd,&#x201d; the Greek said weakly. &#x201c;I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, but I think you do,&#x201d; Douay insisted, as he placed a folder of photographs on the table. &#x201c;Here, look at these...pictures of you meeting with other members of The Agency&#x2019;s board in Rio, going aboard one of the organization&#x2019;s yachts in Cape Town, and exiting their private plane in Dallas.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thorakis took the time to compose himself as he removed two of the photos, examined them, and produced a shrug as he tossed them back onto the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know all sorts of people. If they happen to be associated with this organization of which you speak&#x2014;this...&#x2018;Agency&#x2019;&#x2014;I know nothing about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Douay said sadly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t embarrass yourself. The record is clear. When the cruise ships owned by Se�or Jos� Alvarez began to take business away from you, he somehow drowned in his own swimming pool. That, in spite of the fact that he had been a member of Mexico&#x2019;s Olympic swim team some fifteen years earlier!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then, after a journalist named Harry Meyers wrote a story about the way your tankers dump toxic materials into the Atlantic Ocean, he inexplicably committed suicide. Just two days prior to his wedding!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, and let&#x2019;s not forget Countess Maria Sarkov, who had the terrible misfortune to be hit by a truck as she crossed 42nd Street one week after referring to your wife as &#x2018;an ugly pig&#x2019; in a New York society column. No, my friend, you not only work for The Agency,&#x201d; Douay added grimly, &#x201c;but they pay you in blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yet even The Agency can&#x2019;t do anything about the fact that you and your company have been turned away by bankers in Zurich, London, and New York. Your stock is down thirty percent, the litigation from the oil spill will drag on for ten years, and your cruise ships are sailing half-full. Still, you know best, so we&#x2019;ll speak of more enjoyable things....<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How are your children? Well, I hope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thorakis felt a rising sense of despair, and desperately tried to keep it from showing. The thing he feared most was that he would be the one to lose the Thorakis family fortune, and not only bring shame onto himself, but rob his children of their birthright.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, after an uncomfortable silence, the Greek looked up from his plate.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps I was too hasty in my response,&#x201d; he said hesitantly. &#x201c;What sort of information would you be seeking? Who knows...there may be some way for me to accommodate you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There, you see,&#x201d; Douay replied genially. &#x201c;I knew we could do business! In answer to your question I want to know everything you know. Especially whatever you can tell me about the man called Agent 47.</p><h2>The Favorite Daughter</h2><p>Yuriko hates her name when the children make fun of it and call her "Eureka!" Though she is half Japanese, the teasing makes her want to hide, to retreat even from the art projects she used to love. Fortunately she has a patient, kind father who finds gentle ways of drawing her out and reminding Yuriko of the traditions they share that have always brought her joy: walks in lovely Golden Gate Park, lunch at their favorite sushi restaurant, watching the fog blow in off the bay. It's enough... it's more than enough to face down her challenges with confidence.<br>From the incomparable Allen Say comes another moving story taken from his personal experience and translated to the universal. This tale, dedicated with love to Say's daughter, is one for all parents who want their children to feel pride in their heritage, and to know their own greatest sources of strength and inspiration.<br>THE FAVORITE DAUGHTER will be a favorite for years to come.<br></p><p>Allen Say is the beloved author and illustrator of many acclaimed books for children, including the highly acclaimed <i>Drawing from Memory</i> and <i>The Favorite Daughter</i>, (both published by Scholastic), the Caldecott Medal winner <i>Grandfather's Journey</i> and the Caldecott Honor winner <i>The Boy of the Three-Year Nap</i>. He is known for his technical skill and varied style, and his books pay tribute to Japanese culture, as well as his own personal experiences. His many books include <i>Tree of Cranes</i>, <i>Under the Cherry Blossom Tree</i>, <i>Tea with Milk</i>, and <i>Erika-San</i>. He lives in Portland, Oregon.K-Gr 2-Whereas Drawing from Memory (Scholastic, 2011) revealed a slice of Say's youth, this title is seen through the lens of fatherhood, although the narrator is omniscient. As the story opens, "Yuriko came to stay with her father on Thursday that week." Readers follow the flaxen-haired child through homework assignments that involve bringing a baby picture to school and, later, creating a model of the Golden Gate Bridge. A photograph of Yuriko clad in a red, flowered kimono becomes a source of confusion for her classmates, who associate Japanese appearance with dark hair. When the art teacher mispronounces her name, and the students follow suit, her day goes from bad to worse; miserable, she seeks a new identity upon arriving home. Father and daughter visit a familiar sushi restaurant, Golden Gate Park, and the bridge (shrouded in fog), all of which help the troubled girl process her feelings and inspire a unique response to the art project. Their banter pits paternal teasing mixed with loving support against childlike swings between melodrama and earnestness. Say's command of watercolor, ink, and pencil develops the visual narrative through a combination of uncluttered interiors; peaceful, restorative gardens; and emotionally complex portraits. The concluding photograph of Yuriko as a young woman in Japan (also wearing a kimono) conveys an acceptance and pride regarding her heritage and adds impact to the message.

All of this oral communication that I received had to spill out in some way and it began coming out in what I wrote.

One of her largest tasks was keeping the maids inline, all young girls with hardly a shred of common sense among them. When they should have been straightening the rooms, she&#x2019;d more often than not find them giggling in the hallways or flirting with the boys delivering tea trays or flowers.</p><p>That morning, she&#x2019;d been called into the manager&#x2019;s office and reprimanded for not being harsh enough on her charges.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re soft. We&#x2019;re starting to wonder if you&#x2019;re simply too young for the position,&#x201d; said Mr. Birmingham from behind his walnut desk, which, despite its elegant spindle legs, was roughly the size of a small boat.</p><p>Having recently turned thirty, Sara didn&#x2019;t feel young in the least, not that she&#x2019;d ever acted that way. When she&#x2019;d first arrived at the Langham, she&#x2019;d skipped the giddy overtures of friendship from other maids herage, knowing that she had to stand out if she wanted to move up quickly. Her coolness had paid off, and her higher salary more than made up for the lack of companionship.</p><p>But for Mr. Birmingham, who found pleasure in making the younger maids cry, Sara&#x2019;s self-imposed isolation wasn&#x2019;t enough.</p><p>He directed her to take a seat, but once she had settled herself, the perspective in the room suddenly felt off, as if something in the furniture&#x2019;s configuration had changed since Mr. Birmingham last summoned her to this spot&#x2014;or else she was so annoyed by his request for an interview during the busiest hours of the day that she&#x2019;d worked herself into a kind of nervous imbalance. Sara&#x2019;s employer was short and had the poor luck to have a torso shaped like a chicken egg with a double yolk. She towered over the man by several inches. Yet somehow Mr. Birmingham was peering down at her from his throne-like seat. She stole a glance at the floor. The bottom five inches of his chair legs were stained a different color than the rest. He&#x2019;d had them lengthened.</p><p>When she looked back up, he puffed up like a songbird, clearly peeved that she&#x2019;d noticed.</p><p>She shifted in her seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Birmingham, I will be tougher on the girls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re difficult, give them a slap. Better yet, send them down here and I&#x2019;ll do it for you.&#x201d; He licked his lips.</p><p>Right. She imagined he&#x2019;d enjoy it immensely. &#x201c;Is there anything more?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Mrs. Smythe. Off you go.&#x201d;</p><p>She was still getting used to being called Mrs. Strange how a single promotion afforded not only a living wage but also a new moniker that had nothing to do with her marital status, or lack thereof. No head housekeeper could be called a Miss. Wasn&#x2019;t proper. The girls were still getting used to addressing her by her full name, and she had to be firmer with that as well. It wouldn&#x2019;t do for Mr. Birmingham to overhear them calling her Sara. It might be the last straw on what was a very unstable haystack.</p><p>That hot June afternoon, after patrolling the halls and basement to break up any assignations, she retreated to her office on the sixth floor to double-check the laundry bills. She needed a rest from shooting dour looks at the girls; her face was tired from scowling. The one window in the room was open as wide as possible in order to catch some semblance of a breeze, but the weather refused to cooperate. All day, the air had been still and humid, making the hotel feel&#x2014;and smell&#x2014;a little like the greenhouses at Kew Gardens. A movement from the curtain drew her up from her desk in the hope that an afternoon thunderstorm was brewing.</p><p>To her disappointment, the sky was a hazy blue. She looked across the courtyard and there, one floor below, a flash of flesh caughther eye, a chubby arm with fingers that grasped the edge of the sill. Then another arm flailed out and did the same, followed by a head covered in golden curls. The girl sported a velvet bow on the back of her head at a skewed angle. Sara&#x2019;s breath caught in her chest. Surely a minder would appear at any moment and guide the child back into the room.</p><p>With some effort, the child eased her chest up onto the windowsill and stayed motionless for a second, surveying the ground below, arms dangling downward. Sara willed the child away from danger. If she called out, there was a chance she would frighten the child into pitching farther forward. But still no one came. To her horror, a foot swung up and over the sill&#x2014;three limbs in all. The child was climbing up, possibly drawn to the cooler air and away from the stifling room.</p><p>There was no time to waste. Sara sprang out of her office and down the corridor, one hand clutching the heavy chatelaine of keys that dangled from her waist. She lifted her skirts far higher than was decent and dashed down the stairs, her eyes riveted on the few feet in front of her so she wouldn&#x2019;t lose her footing on the slippery marble. At the fifth floor a couple of guests stepped off the lift and she swooped by them, muttering a quick apology, without losing a beat. Then a turn left and what seemed like an eternal race to the door of room 510. No banging, it might startle the child, and at this point it didn&#x2019;t matter if she was barging in on anyone. Even if doing so was against hotel policy.</p><p>The key turned smoothly in the lock and she opened the door. The girl, wearing a peach-colored dress, now stood upright on the sill facing out, one hand clutching the casing. She had to be around three years old. What was she doing alone?</p><p>Walter, one of the porters, and Mabel, the floor&#x2019;s chambermaid, appeared by Sara&#x2019;s side, breathing heavily. They must have sprinted after her, knowing something was terribly wrong.</p><p>Sara put out her arms to stop Mabel and Walter from moving any farther into the room. &#x201c;Shh. We don&#x2019;t want to send her off balance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s her minder?&#x201d; whispered Mabel. &#x201c;Is anyone in the bedchamber?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Sara took a step into the room, walking as if the floor might give out at any point. The plush rugs softened her footfall.</p><p>As she grew closer, she realized the child was singing to herself. A lullaby about being on a treetop.</p><p>The child turned her head and stared at Sara. Her rosy lips parted and her eyes grew round.</p><p>Sara held out one hand, palm up, and began humming the same tune softly. In response, the child laughed, but then, with the changeability of her age, her eyes suddenly filled with tears.</p><p>&#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; the girl demanded, then shook her head. Sara didn&#x2019;t dare move any farther and her muscles tensed with the effort of doing nothing, staying frozen. A breeze blew in and ruffled the girl&#x2019;s curls, pushing her slightly off balance. If she fell backward, into the room, Sara might be able to reach her in time to break her fall.</p><p>But instead, the little girl overcorrected, and her hand began slipping off the window frame. Such tiny fingernails, tiny fingers.</p><p>Sara lunged forward. Her hand grazed the voluminous skirt of the child&#x2019;s dress and she gripped as much of the material as she could, yanking hard. The girl, shrieking, flew off the ledge, inside, to safety. They hit the ground together in an awkward tangle of limbs and petticoats, the girl practically sitting on Sara&#x2019;s lap.&nbsp;</p><p>The girl twisted around and looked at Sara, blinking in astonishment. Sara was sure she&#x2019;d cry out, but instead the girl resumed her babbling song while reaching up with one hand to stroke Sara&#x2019;s chin.</p><p>&#x201c;Well done, just in time,&#x201d; said Walter as he and Mabel gathered on either side of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think she hurt herself?&#x201d; asked Sara.</p><p>&#x201c;No, not a whit. You broke the fall. Are you all right?&#x201d; Mabel scooped up the child while Sara let Walter help her to her feet. She was straightening her skirts and rubbing her hip, which no doubt would sport a large bruise by tomorrow, when a tall, thin woman appeared in the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;What on earth is going on in here?&#x201d; the woman demanded, clutching the hand of a little girl a few years older than the one held by Mabel.</p><p>The name popped into Sara&#x2019;s head from the guest book: The Hon. Mrs. Theodore Camden. Traveling with three children, a husband, and a small coterie of servants. Mr. Birmingham had instructed Sara that all of the Camdens&#x2019; needs be anticipated, as the wife was the daughter of a baron.</p><p>Sara stepped forward. &#x201c;The child was standing in the window and we brought her inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More like saved her life,&#x201d; said Walter. &#x201c;Mrs. Smythe here leaped in and dragged her back inside in just the nick of time.&#x201d;</p><p>The child, as if realizing the heightened emotions of the grown-ups around her, began to wail. The woman dashed forward and scooped her out of Mabel&#x2019;s arms, holding the girl close. When her cries subsided, Mrs. Camden looked up, as if seeing them all for the first time.</p><p>&#x201c;I thank you for your assistance, but where is her nanny?&#x201d;</p><p>As if on cue, a plain-looking girl stepped into the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; she inquired, her face scrunched up in confusion.</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Morgan, where have you been? Lula almost fell to her death due to your absence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; The girl gazed around at everyone in the room. &#x201c;I popped out for only a minute, to drop off a postcard at the front desk. I thought Mr. Camden was here.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off and she looked about, as if trying to summon him out of thin air.</p><p>&#x201c;You were supposed to be here minding the children.&#x201d;</p><p>The child buried her head in her mother&#x2019;s shoulder, weeping again.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is Luther?&#x201d; Mrs. Camden rushed into the adjoining room and they all followed. Another child&#x2014;a boy who seemed to be around the same age as Lula&#x2014;lay on the enormous bed, fast asleep, his curls damp around his head.</p><p>Sara, standing beside Mrs. Camden, could practically feel the woman&#x2019;s fear and relief emanating from her body, like aftershocks of an earthquake. The nanny took Lula from her arms and set about calming the girl down, avoiding her employer&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>How awful if something had happened. Two little children left alone with a wide-open window; the thought was unimaginable. Sara turned to Mrs. Camden. The woman&#x2019;s profile was precise, her coloring fair other than thick black lashes that framed hazel eyes. Sara had encountered innumerable members of the peerage at the Langham and they all shared a common way of moving in the world, a confidence that their every desire would be met. It was rare to see one in crisis.</p><p>She sensed Walter and Mabel hovering behind them, and became protective of the woman&#x2019;s dignity. &#x201c;Is there anything else we can do, Mrs. Camden?&#x201d; asked Sara.</p><p>&#x201c;No, that is all.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s face softened. &#x201c;Thank you for saving her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Sara nodded to Walter and Mabel and led the way out of the room. Once the door was closed behind them, Sara exhaled with relief.</p><p>&#x201c;That was a close call.&#x201d; Walter rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You were spectacular, Sara. I mean, Mrs. Smythe,&#x201d; said Mabel.</p><p>Sara wanted more than anything to crumple onto the floor, but she couldn&#x2019;t allow her staff to see that.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s more than enough excitement for one day. Back to work. And, Mabel, please remember to address me properly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, Mrs. Smythe.&#x201d;</p><p>Sara turned away and strode down the hallway, grateful her quaking knees were hidden under multiple layers of petticoats and skirts.</p><p>The rest of the day, whenever Sara&#x2019;s mind returned to the events in room 510, her heart thumped wildly in her rib cage. What if she hadn&#x2019;t grabbed the child in time? What if she&#x2019;d had to peer over the edge andsee the lifeless body splayed on the hard ground of the courtyard below? Sleep tonight, in the damp heat of her Bayswater bedsit, would be impossible.</p><p>But there was enough to keep her busy until then. She finished updating the ledgers, and was about to head out to inspect the turndown of the guests&#x2019; rooms when a man rapped on her office door. She knew it was a man from its hard, hollow sound. Maids&#x2019; knuckles were barely audible, already apologizing for disturbing her, but the men, whether Mr. Birmingham or the janitor, had no such qualms.</p><p>She stood and opened the door, expecting Mr. Birmingham to have made a special trip upstairs to upbraid her for causing a scene with the guests. Instead, a stranger&#x2019;s face peered down at her. As if he sensed her discomfort, he stepped back a pace. &#x201c;Mrs. Smythe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. May I help you, sir?&#x201d; He was clearly a hotel guest, dressed in a fitted, bespoke suit with a Broadway silk hat tucked under one arm.</p><p>&#x201c;I apologize for intruding.&#x201d; He wiped his brow with an enormous hand. &#x201c;How do you manage up here, with this insufferable heat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rare occurrence, luckily.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe you saved my daughter Lula today. I wanted to thank you in person. My name is Mr. Theodore Camden.&#x201d; His accent was American, his voice a warm tenor.</p><p>Sara gestured to a chair opposite her desk, offering him a seat. He moved with an unexpected grace, given his large build. Nothing about him was handsome, by standard measures. His head was small in contrast to his broad shoulders, his eyes close-set to an irregular nose. But when put alltogether, he was magnetic. She looked down and closed the ledger in order to stop herself from staring.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad she&#x2019;s safe. She is all right, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; The image of the wailing girl came to mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. We offered her a slice of Battenberg cake and she&#x2019;s completely forgotten the incident.&#x201d; He chuckled before a brief look of pain crossed his face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what would have happened if you hadn&#x2019;t gotten there in time. The twins, Lula and Luther, are constantly getting into trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Best not to think of it."</p><p>Sara was unsure how to proceed. She&#x2019;d never had a hotelguest in her small office, and he was so tall he took up much of the space.</p><p>&#x201c;How did you know what was happening?&#x201d; Mr. Camden leaned back in his chair, his hat in his lap. He didn&#x2019;t seem to realize how indecorous it was to be sitting together like this, even if the door was open, so nothing could be construed as irregular. It was almost as if he enjoyed it, while most guests wouldn&#x2019;t dream of mingling with the staff.<br><br>&#x201c;I can see your hotel room from my window. I stood to get some air and saw her climb up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The girl was supposed to be watching the twins while Mrs. Camden was out. Needless to say, she was fired immediately.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, luckily all turned out well.&#x201d; Other than for the nanny, of course.&#x201c;<br><br>"What is the ratio of staff to guests here?&#x201d; <br><br>Such an odd question. &#x201c;We have three hundred rooms and a staff of approximately four hundred.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;How long have you been head housekeeper?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is my first month.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t come up here just to say than kyou, she was sure. Something else was driving his line of inquiry. She squared her shoulders and leaned slightly forward, as if into a wind, curious to figure him out. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve been working here in some capacity for the past eleven years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know the place well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Birmingham says you&#x2019;re highly efficient.&#x201d; <br><br>Mr. Camden had inquired after her. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of him to s...</p></p><h2>The Lost Coast</h2><p><b>The spellbinding tale of six queer witches forging their own paths, shrouded in the mist, magic, and secrets of the ancient California redwoods.</b><br><br>Danny didn&#x2019;t know what she was looking for when she and her mother spread out a map of the United States and Danny put her finger down on Tempest, California.

Washington City was barely visible as Liberty and I made our way down a winding dirt road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Liberty, I hope you can see better than I can,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I forgot there are no street lights in 1814.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No worries, Revere. Horses can see very well in the dark,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;And I can smell better, too. Well, not just in the dark but all the time. In fact,&#x201d; Liberty sniffed, &#x201c;it smells like someone is cooking dinner. Mmm, a nice carrot and onion stew sounds really&#x2014;whoa!&#x201d; Liberty yelled and reared up, flailing his front legs.<br> <br>The sound of a woman screaming came from somewhere directly in front of us.<br> <br>I hung tight to Liberty&#x2019;s neck until his front hooves were once again on the dirt road. &#x201c;What was that all about,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, but those people spooked me. I didn&#x2019;t see them until the last second,&#x201d; Liberty replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you could see well in the dark,&#x201d; I said with sarcasm.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can. But I had my eyes closed when I was smelling that delicious . . . oh, never mind. We have company,&#x201d; whispered Liberty.<br> <br>A woman and toddler briskly walked to the other side of the road, moving fast and away from us and the city. They appeared to be carrying their household belongings. Both were covered in dirt and looked exhausted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; I asked, concerned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry my horse spooked you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All is well, thank you,&#x201d; the woman replied. &#x201c;We are tired but we are faring as well as possible under the circumstances.&#x201d;<br> <br>The young girl beside her looked to be around seven years old with long brown hair and a high-collared dress. Her tired eyes brightened when she saw Liberty. &#x201c;Your horse is so pretty!&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;Can I pet his nose?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course you may. He loves that almost as much as he loves carrots,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Liberty leaned down and snuggled into the girl&#x2019;s nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are very kind, sir,&#x201d; the woman said in a weary tone. &#x201c;Please be careful. The British are on the edge of the city. We were told to evacuate. There are rumors that four thousand Redcoats are marching toward Washington. They plan to burn the city in revenge for their defeat at York.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you for the warning. We will be on the lookout,&#x201d; I replied, putting a hand to the edge of my tricornered hat to bid them farewell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye-bye, horsey,&#x201d; the little girl said as they walked away into the dark night.<br> <br>&#x201c;Revere, I thought we were going to see the White House,&#x201d; Liberty said, as we pressed forward on the dusty road.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are, but I&#x2019;m a bit disoriented,&#x201d; I replied. I looked down at my map of Washington City in 1814. The Capitol was being built, and the White House is where it still stands today in Washington, D.C. On August 23, 1814, however, the city was still under construction. As we continued to walk we noticed building materials all along the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I can help,&#x201d; said Liberty. &#x201c;After all, I do have Spidey-sense for all things American history.&#x201d; Liberty paused, closed his eyes, and sniffed the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Which way do we go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;The only thing I&#x2019;m getting is the smell of roasted vegetables and boy, does it smell good!&#x201d;<br> <br>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Look over there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s the dome of the Capitol Building. We&#x2019;re almost there.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a few minutes, we arrived at our destination. The light from nearby torches reflected off the white walls of the White House. We picked up our pace as we approached. There was nothing around the building except a road in front and dirt and grass surrounding it. A small gate was left open and we were able to enter the grounds without being stopped.<br> <br>A man approached us carrying small items. &#x201c;President Madison has already left, sir, and I suggest you do the same,&#x201d; the man said as he brushed past.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am starting to think the same thing, Revere,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;Except that delicious smell is coming from the White House.

I knew it was the rare and priceless portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;The First Lady of the United States of America.&#x201d;<br> <br>As we approached I saw Dolley place the rolled-up portrait into the hands of a young African-American man.<br> <br>&#x201c;You there, come help us with this painting,&#x201d; Mrs. Madison said. I knew it was the First Lady because I had studied a painting of her before we left modern day. She had dark hair, dark eyes, and pale skin. She continued to dart back and forth as she gathered and boxed other documents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Madison,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;we are certainly happy to help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Help us roll this painting so that it is not damaged.&#x201d;<br> <br>I jumped off Liberty and helped the others carefully roll the giant canvas.<br> <br>&#x201c;The President has gone to the battlefield, and everyone is exhausted. I thank you for your help. I suspect the British will be here soon to destroy Washington City, so we are removing the items that are most valuable to the country. It is a small thing, perhaps, but I think it is important,&#x201d; Mrs. Madison said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is the portrait of George Washington so important?&#x201d; I asked.</p><h2>One Piece (Omnibus Edition), Vol. 12: Includes vols. 34, 35 &amp; 36 (12)</h2><p>As a child, Monkey D.

Bringing a historical perspective to bear on the regimes of race that colonizers have sought to impose on Aboriginal people in Australia, on Blacks and Native Americans in the United States, on Ashkenazi Jews in Western Europe, on Arab Jews in Israel/Palestine, and on people of African descent in Brazil, this book shows how race marks and reproduces the different relationships of inequality into which Europeans have coopted subaltern populations: territorial dispossession, enslavement, confinement, assimilation, and removal.<br><br> Charting the different modes of domination that engender specific regimes of race and the strategies of anti-colonial resistance they entail, the book powerfully argues for cross-racial solidarities that respect these historical differences.</p><p><b>Patrick Wolfe</b> is a writer and historian who lives and works in Wurundjeri country near Healesville, Australia.

Patrick Wolfe, preeminent scholar of settler colonial studies, tackles this question with theoretical sophistication and vivid historical detail. Spanning four continents and four centuries, Wolfe reveals the operations of race-making in specific historical processes, in the always contingent struggles over land, labor, culture, and power.

Skilfully combining theoretical analysis with a myriad of empirical references from numerous historical and geographical contexts, he offers a critical reading of the existing literature on populism, demonstrating its dependency on the theorists of &#x201c;mass psychology,&#x201d; such as Taine and Freud. <i>On Populist Reason</i> is essential reading for all those interested in the question of political identities in the present day.</p></p><p><p><b>Ernesto Laclau</b> (1935&#x2013;2014) was Professor of Political Theory in the Department of Government, University of Essex, and Distinguished Professor for Humanities and Rhetorical Studies at Northwestern University.

This is what makes Laclau&#x2019;s long-awaited book so important. Arguably, populism has always been the governing concept in Laclau&#x2019;s work and in <i>On Populist Reason</i>, he lays out his position with great power and analytical clarity.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Simon Critchley</b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>On Populist Reason</i> helped to explain the rise of the new leftist sentiment sweeping Latin America from Venezuela to Ecuador to Argentina&#x2014;he was a key influence on Kirchner, who valued Laclau&#x2019;s support in reaching out beyond his Peronista base to the grassroots activists who had been occupying hundreds of factories. Laclau&#x2019;s sympathy for the Latin American new left was most unwelcome to those who were alarmed by the mobilisation of the poor and excluded.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Robin Blackburn</b><br><br> &#x201c;There is no doubt that Laclau&#x2019;s is an extremely important contribution to political theory. He demonstrates, through exemplification, the workings of populism and, by extension, hegemonic politics.

Everyone in the sleepy Scottish town of Lochdubh adores elderly Mrs. Gentle - everyone but Hamish Macbeth, that is. Hamish thinks the gentle lady is quite sly and vicious, and the citizens of Lochdubh think he is overly cranky. Perhaps it's time for him to get married, they say.But who has time for marriage when there's a murder to be solved? When Mrs. Gentle dies under mysterious circumstances, the town is shocked and outraged. Chief Detective Inspector Blair suspects members of her family, but Hamish Macbeth thinks there's more to the story, and begins investigating the truth behind this lady's gentle exterior.</p><p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series. Beaton is also the author of the bestselling Agatha Raisin series, which will air as an eight-episode dramatic series on Sky1, starring Ashley Jensen. She lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.Poor Hamish Macbeth has so many battles to fight at one time. First, his beloved police station is, again, in danger of closing. Second, he's the only one suspicious of village newcomer Mrs. Gentle. Third, once more he's thinking about getting engaged. Narrator Graeme Malcolm is splendid; every character is distinctive with his skilled delivery. He's excellent in his portrayal of Macbeth's chief inspector's self-important rantings, the Russian prostitute and the policewoman who comes seeking her, and, of course, the horrible Mrs. Gentle. Hamish remains his bumbling, unassuming self as he solves a murder with the help of whiskey-soaked Jimmy Anderson. This is an outstanding installment in Beaton's delightful series, and Malcolm makes a sparkling story even better.

This vision of the sublime is the source of all that is enigmatic and paradoxical about Buddhism. In <b>Verses from the Center</b>, Stephen Batchelor explores the history of this concept and provides readers with translations of the most important poems ever written on the subject, the poems of 2nd century philosopher Nagarjuna.</p><p>Ex-monk Stephen Batchelor has stirred up controversy in the past by marrying Buddhism to secular agnosticism. Now he goes right to the greatest Buddhist sage after Sakyamuni, Nagarjuna, for corroboration. In this translation of Nagarjuna's seminal work, <i>Verses from the Center</i>, we see Nagarjuna turning a skeptical eye to all dogmatic beliefs. But Batchelor, through his emphasis on the poetics of the work, moves away from polemics to experience--experience of the emptiness that pervades existence and teaches deeper truths. <i>Verses from the Center</i> is an extended meditation on the implications of emptiness, and thanks to Batchelor's limpid rendering, it prompts a meditative reading. Batchelor's opening essay, half of the book, is one of the best introductions you'll find on Nagarjuna's notion of emptiness, emphasizing that emptiness ultimately brings us back to face the world. In a chapter called "Acts," Nagarjuna says: <blockquote> My acts are irrevocable <p> Because they have no essence... </p><p> Where are the doers of deeds </p><p> Absent among their conditions? </p><p> Imagine a magician </p><p> Who creates a creature </p><p> Who creates other creatures. </p><p> Acts I perform are creatures </p><p> Who create others.</p></blockquote> <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Stephen Batchelor is a former monk in the Tibetan and Zen traditions and the author of the national bestseller <b>Buddhism Without Beliefs</b>.

Surrounded by people who sought to limit her potential, Doris vowed to turn the tables after the owner of a jewelry store threw her out when a white customer arrived. Neither racism nor poverty would hold her back; she would get what she wanted and help her mother escape an abusive relationship.</p><p>Using her southern charm, quick wit, and fascination with magic as her tools, Payne began shoplifting small pieces of jewelry from local stores. Over the course of six decades, her talents grew with each heist. Becoming an expert world-class jewel thief, she daringly pulled off numerous diamond robberies and her Jewish boyfriend fenced the stolen gems to Hollywood celebrities.</p><p>Doris&#x2019;s criminal exploits went unsolved well into the 1970s&#x2014;partly because the stores did not want to admit that they were duped by a black woman. Eventually realizing Doris was using him, her boyfriend turned her in. She was arrested after stealing a diamond ring in Monte Carlo that was valued at more than half a million dollars. But even prison couldn&#x2019;t contain this larger-than-life personality who cleverly used nuns as well as various ruses to help her break out. With her arrest in 2013 in San Diego, Doris&#x2019;s fame skyrocketed when media coverage of her astonishing escapades exploded. </p><p>Today, at eighty-seven, Doris, as bold and vibrant as ever, lives in Atlanta, and is celebrated for her glamorous legacy. She sums up her adventurous career best: &#x201c;It beat being a teacher or a maid.&#x201d; A rip-roaringly fun and exciting story as captivating and audacious as <em>Catch Me if You Can</em> and <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?&#x2014;Diamond Doris</em> is the portrait of a captivating anti-hero who refused to be defined by the prejudices and mores of a hypocritical society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Doris Payne was born in Slab Fork, West Virginia.

Stretching from neighboring Iran throughout the Mediterranean to North Africa, the roots of Greg's culinary history are here in the land of his forbears, and together with writing partner Lucy Malouf, he embarks on a month-long culinary journey. <br><br>The cuisine in <i>Saha</i> is traditional and inspirational, enticingly spiced and fragrant with flower waters. From hearty peasant dishes to more subtly spiced specialties from ancient palaces, the dishes are complex in flavor yet not too complicated to make at home. Heartwarming stories and recipes from the people Greg and Lucy meet on their journey are teamed with evocative images and Greg's own unique take on history. The rich and exciting cuisine from Lebanon and Syria captures the spirit of the modern and the ancient, the characters, dishes, flavors and colors beautifully portrayed in this highly illustrated and lavishly designed Middle Eastern Cookbook.<br><br><b>Authentic recipes include:</b><ul><li> Spinach, Lentil and Lemon Soup, Bedouin-style</li><li> Aleppo-style Sausage Rolls</li><li> Upside-down Poached Chicken and Eggplant Pilaf</li><li> Arabic Fish Stew with Lemon and Saffron and Hot Pepper Rouille</li><li> Double-cooked Duck with Cinnamon, Honey, Cardamom and Mastic</li><li> Lamb Shawarma</li><li> Sambousek Pastries with Cheese and Leek</li><li> Lebanese Doughnuts with Lemon Syrup</li><li> Raspberry Turkish Delight Truffles</li><li> Turkish Coffee</li> </ul><b>From the forward by Anthony Bourdain:</b><br><i>There is no doubt that this is a country and a culinary tradition busting with possibilities. All that's needed now, is for someone to explore them and share them with the rest of us. Fortunately, Greg and Lucy Malouf have.</i></p><p><b>Greg Malouf </b>was born in Melbourne, Australia, to Lebanese parents. He served his formal apprenticeship in several of Australia's finest restaurants before working internationally. He has forged a unique style of cooking that combines Middle Eastern tradition with contemporary flair. He now cooks at Melbourne's MoMo restaurant and is the co-author with partner Lucy Malouf of the multi-award-winning <i>Arabesque</i> and <i>Moorish.</i><br><br><b>Lucy Malouf</b> is a Melbourne-based writer and editor. Lucy regularly contributes to the major Australian newspapers, food magazines and food and wine-based websites. She is also a restaurant reviewer and feature writer for the leading Melbourne food guides.Lebanese and Syrian cuisine gets an Australian accent in this half-cookbook, half-travelogue by the formerly married Maloufs. Greg, the chef, infuses the piquant classical flavors and age-old methods with new styling (Parmesan-Crumbed Quail), and sometimes vice-versa (Caesar salad with air-dried beef, Swiss Chard Risotto with Lobster), but he also presents many classics straight up, from Bedouin spinach and Lentil Soup to Lamb Shawarma and Crunchy Sesame Pistachio Cookies. Lucy's narrative of the pair's month-long sojourn in the Middle East provides a skeleton for the book, as her descriptions of their visits to dairies, butchers, bakers and preserve-makers precede recipes that incorporate yogurt and cheese, meats, assorted breads and condiments like the powerful red pepper paste or bitter orange marmalade. Her accounts of restaurants and sightseeing at times sound overly steeped in the tone of breathless articles from high-end travel magazines, but she also includes a good deal of historical information. Harvey's splendid photography of people and landscapes in addition to food give the book an authentic and lively flair. The recipe instructions frequently lack specificity, but experienced cooks intrigued by the rich traditions of cooking and culture (and not dissuaded by the price) will find a solid guide in this book. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Combining salesmanship and media savvy, he created bright, smooth, and colorful logos for major corporations that included Greyhound, Exxon, and Nabisco. His designs for Studebaker automobiles, Sears Coldspot refrigerators, Lucky Strike cigarette packs, and Pennsylvania Railroad locomotives are iconic. Beyond his timeless designs, Loewy carefully built an international reputation through the assiduous courting of journalists and tastemakers to become the face of both a new profession and a consumer-driven vision of the American dream.</p><p>In <i>Streamliner</i>, John Wall traces the evolution of an industry through the lens of Loewy&#x2019;s eclectic life, distinctive work, and invented persona. How, he asks, did Loewy build a business while transforming himself into a national brand a half century before "branding" became relevant? Placing Loewy in context with the emerging consumer culture of the latter half of the twentieth century, Wall explores how his approach to business complemented&#x2015;or differed from&#x2015;that of his well-known contemporaries, including industrial designers Henry Dreyfuss, Walter Teague, and Norman Bel Geddes. Wall also reveals how Loewy tailored his lifestyle to cement the image of "designer" in the public imagination, and why the self-promotion that drove Loewy to the top of his profession began to work against him at the end of his career. <i>Streamliner</i> is an important and engaging work on one of the longest-lived careers in industrial design.</p></p><p><p>The true story of Raymond Loewy, whose designs are still celebrated for their unerring ability to advance American consumer taste.</p><p><b>John Wall</b>, a former journalist, spent 23 years as a higher education public relations specialist at Penn State University and Juniata College.</p></p><h2>The Vitamin Cure for Eye Disease: How to Prevent and Treat Eye Disease Using Nutrition and Vitamin Supplementation</h2><p>This text will be an indispensable tool for people seeking therapeutic, natural help for specific eye diseases as well as those wanting to maintain their healthy eyes later in life.</p><p>Robert G.

By the sixteenth century, it had become an upscale must-have accessory. This lighthearted, illustrated examination of its history pulls in writers from Rabelais to Shakespeare and figures from Henry VIII to Alice Cooper. Glover&#x2019;s witty and entertaining prose reveals how male vanity turned a piece of cloth into a bulging and absurd representation of masculinity itself. The codpiece, painted again and again by masters such as Titian, Holbein, Giorgione, and Bruegel, became a symbol of royalty, debauchery, virility, and religious seriousness&#x2014;all in one.&nbsp;<br> <br>Centuries of male self-importance and delusion are on display in this highly enjoyably new title. Glover&#x2019;s book moves from paintings to contemporary culture and back again as it charts the growing popularity of the codpiece and its eventual decline.

After all, it had few slaves and showed few signs that slavery would even flourish. But civil war tore this territory apart in the 1850s and 60s, and "Bleeding Kansas" became a forbidding symbol for the nationwide clash over slavery that followed.<br><br>Many free-state Kansans seemed to care little about slaves, and many proslavery Kansans owned not a single slave. But the failed promise of the Kansas-Nebraska Act-when fraud in local elections subverted the settlers' right to choose whether Kansas would be a slave or free state-fanned the flames of war. While other writers have cited slavery or economics as the cause of unrest, Nicole Etcheson seeks to revise our understanding of this era by focusing on whites' concerns over their political liberties. The first comprehensive account of "Bleeding Kansas" in more than thirty years, her study re-examines the debate over slavery expansion to emphasize issues of popular sovereignty rather than slavery's moral or economic dimensions.<br><br>The free-state movement was a coalition of settlers who favored black rights and others who wanted the territory only for whites, but all were united by the conviction that their political rights were violated by nonresident voting and by Democratic presidents' heavy-handed administration of the territories. Etcheson argues that participants on both sides of the Kansas conflict believed they fought to preserve the liberties secured by the American Revolution and that violence erupted because each side feared the loss of meaningful self-governance.<br><br><i>Bleeding Kansas</i> is a gripping account of events and people-rabble-rousing Jim Lane, zealot John Brown, Sheriff Sam Jones, and others-that examines the social milieu of the settlers along with the political ideas they developed. Covering the period from the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act to the 1879 Exoduster Migration, it traces the complex interactions among groups inside and outside the territory, creating a comprehensive political, social, and intellectual history of this tumultuous period in the state's history.<br><br>As Etcheson demonstrates, the struggle over the political liberties of whites may have heightened the turmoil but led eventually to a broadening of the definition of freedom to include blacks. Her insightful re-examination sheds new light on this era and is essential reading for anyone interested in the ideological origins of the Civil War.<br><br></p><p>"Prodigiously researched and boldly written, Etcheson's study reopens the important story of 'Bleeding Kansas' in a thought provoking and compelling way."--Michael Fellman, coauthor of <i>That Terrible War: The Civil War and Its Aftermath</i> <p> </p><p>"Kansas Territory did indeed bleed for freedom, but as Etcheson's elegant, balanced, and deep account shows, the 'slaves' about whom combatants there were most passionate were white."--Craig Miner, author of <i>Kansas: The History of the Sunflower State, 1854-2000</i></p><p> </p><p>"An ambitious, important, long-overdue, and very successful revisionist history of the organization of Kansas Territory. . . .

R&#x16b;ta Vanagait&#x117;, a best-selling Lithuanian writer, was motivated by her recent discoveries that some of her relatives had played a role in the mass murder of Jews and that Lithuanian officials had tried to hide the complicity of local collaborators. Efraim Zuroff, a noted Israeli Nazi-hunter, had both professional and personal motivations. He had worked for years to bring Lithuanian war criminals to justice and to compel local authorities to tell the truth about the Holocaust in their country. The fact that his maternal grandparents were born in Lithuania and that he was named for a great-uncle who was murdered with his family in Vilnius with the active help of Lithuanians made his search personal as well.<br><br>Journey with an Enemy exposes the significant role played by local political leaders and the prewar Lithuanian administration that remained in place during the Nazi occupation in implementing the Nazis&#x2019; Final Solution. It also tackles the sensitive issue of the motivation of thousands of ordinary Lithuanians in the murder of their Jewish neighbors. At the heart of the book, these are the issues that R&#x16b;ta and Efraim discuss, debate, and analyze as they crisscross the country to visit dozens of Holocaust mass murder sites in Lithuania and neighboring Belarus. During the journey, they searched for neglected graves, interviewed eyewitnesses, and looked for traces of the rich Jewish life that had existed in hundreds of Jewish communities throughout Lithuania. This compelling book recounts their harrowing journey.</p><p>R&#x16b;ta Vanagait&#x117;, one of Lithuania&#x2019;s most popular public personalities and the successful author of numerous bestsellers, became persona non grata in her homeland after this book was originally published in Lithuania. She currently lives in Jerusalem. <br><br>Efraim Zuroff is the chief Nazi hunter of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and director of the center's Israel Office and East European affairs. Five documentaries have been made about his work, including &#x201c;The Search for Doctor Death,&#x201d; (BBC 2009). A Holocaust historian, popular lecturer worldwide, and author, he lives in Jerusalem.This is a painful and important book&#x2014;painful because so much of it consists of excruciating eyewitness accounts to the torment inflicted on Lithuanian Jews by their fellow citizens, and important because so little has appeared in English on not only this terrible dimension of the Holocaust, but also the reluctance, even refusal, of the descendants of the killers to acknowledge their role in the murders all these years later. The account of the Lithuanian government&#x2019;s vacillations in dealing with the nation&#x2019;s past is particularly eye-opening. -- Peter Hayes, author of Why? Explaining the Holocaust<br><br>Our People is an immensely valuable addition to our knowledge about the genocidal murder of Lithuanian Jews. The authors&#x2019; remarkable investigation has brought to light the active role played by Lithuanian citizens, often with minimal oversight by Nazi occupiers, at hundreds of killing sites.

Illustrations/photos.</p><p>Timothy Leary--Harvard University psychologist, social change activist, psychedelia enthusiast, and cyberspace pioneer--died on May 31, 1996, as this edition of <i>Psychedelic Prayers and Other Meditations</i> was in progress. Translated "from English to psychedelese" in 1965, these 56 poems were inspired by the Tao Te Ching (Way of Life), ancient spiritual writings of Taoist philosopher Lao Tsu. Leary believed Tsu's writings would serve as an excellent guidebook for psychedelic sessions, so--armed with nine English translations--he sat under a tree in India and attempted to distill the works' essential meanings (from a drug-induced perspective, of course). <p> As meditation is to Eastern spiritual traditions, psychedelic drugs were to Timothy Leary. The counterculture guru encouraged people to transcend ego-centered perspectives of ordinary human consciousness, go beyond the dualities of right and wrong, and liberate themselves from their limitations. The Tao Te Ching fit these purposes quite well, he thought, and Ralph Metzner, who wrote the book's introduction, agrees: "These meditations on the art and science of consciousness expansion are serene, sensuous, funny and wise. They are among the most inspired writings by one of the outstanding visionary geniuses of the 20th century."</p>All Things Pass<br> Along The Grain<br> Ascending Ladder Of Chakras<br> Clear Water<br> Concerning Dosage And Capacity<br> The Conscious Application Of Strength<br> The Crown Chakra<br> The Design Has No Plan<br> Ethereal Pool Without Source<br> Falling Free<br> For God's Sake -- Feel Good<br> Fourfold Representation Of The Mystery<br> Gate Of The Soft Mystery<br> The Guide<br> He Who Knows The Center Endures<br> Hearing<br> The Heart Chakra<br> Hold Fast To The Void<br> Homage To The Awe-full Seer<br> How To Escape The Trap Of Beauty And Goodness<br> How To Recognize The Tao Imprint<br> Illustration Of A Tao Imprint<br> The Innosense Of The Sensual<br> Jewelled Indifference<br> Keep In Touch<br> Lao Tse's Mind Becomes Pre-occupied With Difficult Subject<br> The Lesson Of Seed<br> The Lesson Of Water<br> Let There Be Simple Natural Things During The Session<br> Life, Light, Love.

Every hike contains the four essentials of a great canyoneering route: spectacular canyons, intimate narrows, big views, and physical challenge. Although the routes are difficult, newcomers to the canyons will also find detailed information here that can be used to plan less demanding excursions. Hikes include Muddy Creek in the San Rafael Swell, Dirty Devil North, Dirty Devil South, Dark Canyon, White Canyon, Escalante East, and Escalante South. For experienced canyoneers.</p></p><p>As Steve Allen proclaims in his introduction, "<i>Canyoneering 2</i> is not for everyone." Utah's local canyoneering guru has carefully laid out seven multiday backpack trips that are very demanding and only recommended for advanced hikers with technical rock-climbing skills. Muddy Creek, the Dirty Devil, Dark Canyon, White Canyon, and the Escalante east are all remote and seldom-seen routes. In fact, Dark Canyon is considered one of the most remote areas in the country, which sees only six to eight visitors every year. Still interested? Allen's guide gives you a good head start with preparation chapters, plenty of helpful tips, and excellent landmark descriptions for the confusing, often baffling desert terrain. <i>--Ben Tiffany</i><p><b>Steve Allen</b> has explored the canyons of southern Utah for over twenty-five years.

Miss Ida, as she&#x2019;s known throughout her Bronx community, isn&#x2019;t your typical runner. Her fierce independence helped her through the Depression and the Civil Rights movement. But her greatest trials were yet to come.</p><p>Ida&#x2019;s two sons were brutally murdered. Justice was never found. Ida felt like she didn&#x2019;t have the strength to carry on and she couldn&#x2019;t hope anymore. But encouraged by her daughter, Ida put on her first pair of running shoes at the age of sixty-seven and began to chase the paralyzing sorrow from her heart.</p><p>Running gave light and new energy to Ida, and since her first race nearly thirty-five years ago, she&#x2019;s kept running and never looked back. Holding the world record for the fastest time in the 60-meter dash for the 95-99 age group, Ida isn&#x2019;t slowing down. Now she gives us a clear picture of what it means to overcome obstacles.</p><p>Ida Keeling shares her inspirational story about growing up as a child of immigrants during the Depression and later raising four children as a single mother. She offers time-tested truths gathered from a lifetime of watching a nation change and from a life-long faith in Jesus. &#x201c;Every night, I thank him for my many blessings, for his guidance, for his protection,&#x201d; Ida says, &#x201c;And every night he tells me, 'Miss Ida, you just keep on, because I ain't done with you yet."</p></p><p><p>102-year-old Ida Potter Keeling is a mother, activist, and runner. Miss Ida, as she is known in her Bronx community, grew up the child of immigrants during the Depression. She began working to help provide for her family at age 12. After her husband passed, she raised her four children alone in a single bedroom apartment while serving as an active member in the Civil Rights movement. She started running at 67 years old to chase away the grief following the murders of her two sons. Today, Ida is a world record-holder for the 60-meter dash in the 95-99 age group, the 100-meter dash for the 100-104 age group, and continues to set new records with each race.</p><br><br><p>Anita Diggs is the author of seven fiction and nonfiction books.

This is undoubtably an ineffective way of encouraging people to develop critical thinking about religion. This unique approach to skepticism presents fifty commonly heard reasons people often give for believing in a God and then raises legitimate questions regarding these reasons, showing in each case that there is much room for doubt. Whether you&#39;re a believer, a complete skeptic, or somewhere in between, you&#39;ll find this review of traditional and more recent arguments for the existence of God refreshing, approachable, and enlightening.From religion as the foundation of morality to the authority of sacred books, the compelling religious testimony of influential people, near-death experiences, arguments from Intelligent Design, and much more, Harrison respectfully describes each rationale for belief and then politely shows the deficiencies that any good skeptic would point out. As a journalist who has traveled widely and interviewed many highly accomplished people, quite a number of whom are believers, the author appreciates the variety of belief and the ways in which people seek to make religion compatible with scientific thought. Nonetheless, he shows that, despite the prevalence of belief in God or religious belief in intelligent people, in the end there are no unassailable reasons for believing in a God.For skeptics looking for appealing ways to approach their believing friends or believers who are not afraid to consider a skeptical challenge, this book makes for very stimulating reading.</p><p><b>GUY P.

Suitable for homeopathic students and practitioners at all levels, this revised edition has been updated with the addition of several new chapters. The material is illustrated with case histories throughout and contains many suggestions and ideas not found in any other homeopathic book.</p><p>This book is one of my most-used books on homeopathy. It includes a wide range of all the methodologies that can be applied. It reminds us that whilst classical homeopathy can be fantastic, it is only a tool, and there are many other tools we can use. It talks about organ remedies, Eizyagas layers, nosodes, the Chakras and many more and I think it is essential for any homeopath to have this book. Ian Watson writes in an easy-to-read style and provides good case examples of each methodology. It is refreshing to see an author take an open-minded view and show us that there are many ways to approach a case. I can&#39;t recommend it enough. A.

Lester not only looks at the reasons why addressing the ideas of hope and despair has been overlooked by pastoral theology and other social and behavioral sciences. He also offers a starting point for the development of addressing these important dimensions of human life. He provides clinical theories and methods for pastoral assessment of and intervention with those who despair. He also puts forth strategies for assessing the future stories of those who despair and offers a corrective to these stories through deconstruction, reframing, and reconstruction.</p></p><p>In this ground-breaking book, pastoral counselor Andrew Lester demonstrates that pastoral theology (as well as social and behavioral sciences) has neglected to address effectively the predominant cause of human suffering: a lack of hope, a sense of futurelessness.

But this book does. With fresh insight and a deep personal spirituality, Horan points out that the desire, uncertainty, and love we experience in relationship with God resembles our earthly relationships: We set aside time for the people who are most important to us. Horan reminds us that St. Francis of Assisi understood and even described his relationship with God in a similar way. Drawing from the Franciscan tradition, <i>Dating God</i> encourages us to see St. Francis's spirituality in a new light, challenging us to reexamine our own spirituality, prayer, and relationships, and inviting us into a more intimate relationship with our Creator.<br><br><b>The audio edition of this book can be downloaded via Audible.</b> &nbsp;</p><p><b> Daniel P.

Warriors, they played the round not like children, with a pair of stones, but with the spinning blades of the <i>as&#x2019;ei,</i> that could wound or kill. On the name-beat, the snap of fingers, the <i>as&#x2019;ei</i> flew across the seated circle of players, and skilled hands seized the hilts in mid-turn, to beat the time and hurl the blades on in the next name-beat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fire-child, star-child, what is Kel?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sword-bearers, song-weavers, that is Kel.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played without words, with only the rhythm of their hands and the weapons, flesh and steel. The rhythm was as old as time and as familiar as childhood. The game had more meaning than the act, more than the simplicity of the words. The Game of the People, it was called.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dawn-child, earth-child, what is Sen?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Rune-makers, home-leaders, that is Sen.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kel&#x2019;en who flinched, whose eye failed or whose wits wandered, had no value in the House. The boys and girls and women of the Kath played with stones to learn their skill. Those who became kel&#x2019;ein played thereafter with edged steel. The Kel, like the mothers and children of the gentle Kath, laughed as they played. They of Kel-caste were brief and bright as moths. They enjoyed life, because they knew this.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Then-child, now-child, what are we?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dream-seekers, life-bearers, we are&#x2014;</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A door opened, echoing, the sound rolling through the hollows and depths of the tower. Sen Sathell broke in upon them, suddenly and without warning or courtesies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rhythm ceased. The blades rested in the hands of Niun, the youngest kel&#x2019;en. The Kel as a whole inclined their heads in respect to Sathell s&#x2019;Delas, chief of Sen-caste, the scholars. Gold-robed he was, like light breaking into the dark hall of the martial Kel, and he was very old&#x2014;the oldest man of all in the House.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Kel&#x2019;anth,&#x201d; he said quietly, addressing Eddan, his counterpart in the Kel, &#x201c;&#x2014;kel&#x2019;ein&#x2014;news has come. The rumor is the war has ended. The regul have asked the humans for peace.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was utter silence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An abrupt move. The <i>as&#x2019;ei</i> whirred and buried points in the painted plaster of the far wall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The youngest kel&#x2019;en rose and veiled himself, and stalked from the gathering, leaving shock in his wake.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sen&#x2019;anth and the kel&#x2019;anth looked at each other, old men and kinsmen, helpless in their distress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the deepest shadows one of the dusei, a brown, slope-shouldered mass larger than a man, stirred and rose, ambling forth into the light in that mournful, abstracted manner of dusei. It pushed its way irreverently between the two elders, thrusting its massive head at the kel&#x2019;anth, who was its master, seeking comfort.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kel&#x2019;anth Eddan patted the beast with age-smooth fingers and looked up at the old scholar who, outside the divisions of caste and duty, was his half-brother. &#x201c;Is the news beyond any doubt?&#x201d; he asked, the least trace of hope yet remaining in his voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes. The source is regul official communications, no city rumor. It seems completely reliable.&#x201d; Sathell gathered his robes about him and, tucking them between his knees, settled on the carpeted floor among the kel&#x2019;ein, who eased aside to make room for him in their circle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were, these ten, the elders of the House, save one.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were mri.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their tongue, when they made this statement, they were merely saying that they were of the People. Their word for other species was tsi&#x2019;mri, which meant not-people, and summed up mri philosophy, religion, and the personal attitudes of the elders at once.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were, as a species, golden-toned. Mri legends said that the People were born of the sun: skin, eyes, coarse shoulder-length manes, all were bronze or gold. Their hands and feet were narrow and long, and they were a tall, slender race. Their senses, even in great age, were very keen, their hearing in particular most sensitive. Their golden eyes were lid-folded, double-lidded as well, for a nictitating membrane acted on reflex to protect their vision against blowing dust.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were, as outsiders believed, a species of warriors, of mercenaries&#x2014;for outsiders saw the Kel, and rarely the Sen, and never the Kath. Mri served outsiders for hire&#x2014;served the regul, the massive tsi&#x2019;mri merchants native to Nurag of the star Mab. For many centuries, mri kel&#x2019;ein had hired out to protect regul commerce between-worlds, generally hired by one regul company as defense against the ambitions and ruthlessness of some business rival, and mri had therefore fought against mri. Those years and that service had been good for the People, this trying of one kel&#x2019;en of a certain service against the kel&#x2019;en of another, in proper and traditional combat, as it had always been. Such trials-at-aims refined the strength of the People, eliminating the weak and unfit and giving honor to the strong. In those days the tsi&#x2019;mri regul had recognized themselves to be incapable of fighting and unskilled in planning strategies, and sensibly left all matters of conflict to the mri Kel to settle in the mri fashion.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the last forty years, mri had served all regul combined against all humans, a bitter and ugly conflict, lacking honor and lacking any satisfactions from the enemy. The mri elders were old enough to remember the life before, and knew therefore what changes had been wrought by the war; and they were not pleased with them. Humans were mass-fighters, animals of the herd, and simply understood no other way of war. Mri, who fought singly, had early suspected this, tested it with their lives, found it bitterly true. Humans rejected <i>a&#x2019;ani,</i> honorable combat, would not respect challenge, understood nothing but their own way, which was widespread destruction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mri had bent themselves to learn humanity, the way of the enemy, and had begun to adjust their operations and their manner of service to the regul accordingly. Mri were professionals when it came to combat. Innovation in the yin&#x2019;ein, the ancient weapons that were used in <i>a&#x2019;ani,</i> was dishonorable and unthinkable; but innovation in the zahen&#x2019;ein, in modern arms, was a simple matter of retooling and adjusting methods, a matter of competency in the profession they followed for a livelihood.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regul, unfortunately, were not as capable of adapting to new tactics. Regul had vast and accurate memories. They could not forget what had always occurred, but conversely they could hardly conceive at all of what had not yet happened, and did not make plans against it happening. Hitherto the regul had depended on mri entirely in the matter of their personal safety, and mri foresight&#x2014;for mri could imagine&#x2014;had shielded them and compensated for that regul blindness to the unexpected; but in latter days, when the war began to take regul lives and threaten regul properties, regul took matters into their own unskilled hands. Regul issued orders, prudent in their own estimation, for actions which were militarily impossible.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mri had attempted to obey, for honor&#x2019;s sake.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mri had died in their thousands, for honor&#x2019;s sake.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the House, on this world, there lived only thirteen mri. Two were young. The rest were the makers of policy, a council of the old, the veteran. Long centuries ago the House had numbered more than two thousand in the Kel alone. In this present age all but these few had gone their way to the war, to die.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their war had been lost, by regul, who asked the humans for peace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sathell looked about him and considered these old ones, kel&#x2019;ein who had lived beyond their own years of service, whose memories gave them in some matters the perspective of sen&#x2019;ein. They were Husbands to the she&#x2019;pan, masters-of-arms while there had been Kath children to teach; and there was Pasev, the only surviving kel&#x2019;e&#x2019;en of the House, she most skilled in the yin&#x2019;ein next Eddan himself. There were Dahacha and Sirain of Nisren; Palazi and Quaras and Lieth of Guragen, itself a dead House, taking refuge with the Mother of this one and adopted by her as Husbands. And from yet another dead House were Liran and Debas, truebrothers. These were part of an age that had already vanished, a time the People would not see again. Sathell felt their sadness, sensed it reflected in the beasts that huddled together in the shadows. Eddan&#x2019;s dus, whose species was reputedly never friendly with any caste but the warrior Kel, sniffed critically at the scholar&#x2019;s gold robes and suffered himself to be touched, then heaved his great bulk a little closer, wrinkled rolls of down-furred flesh, shamelessly accepting affection where it was offered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Eddan,&#x201d; said Sathell, stroking the beast&#x2019;s warm shoulder, &#x201c;I must tell you also: it is very likely that the masters will cede this world if the humans should demand it as part of the peace.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That would be,&#x201d; said Eddan, &#x201c;a very large settlement.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not according to what we have just heard. It is rumored that the humans have secured the whole front, that the regul lords are in complete withdrawal, that the humans are in such a position now that they can touch all the contested areas. They have taken Elag.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence. Elsewhere in the tower a door closed. At last Eddan shrugged, a move of his slender fingers. &#x201c;Then the humans will surely demand this world. There is very little that they will miss in their desire for revenge. And the regul have left us open to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It is incredible,&#x201d; said Pasev. &#x201c;Gods! there was no need, no need at all for the regul to have abandoned Elag. The People could have held there&#x2014;could have turned the humans, if they had been given the equipment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sathell made a helpless gesture. &#x201c;Perhaps. But held for whom? The regul withdrew, took everything that was needed there for the defense, pulled ships from under their control. Now we&#x2014;Kesrith&#x2014;have become the border. You are right. It is very likely that the regul will not resist here either; in fact, it is not reasonable for them to do so. So we have done all that we could do. We have advised, we have warned&#x2014;and if our employers refused to take that advice, then there is little we can do but cover their retreat, since we cannot restrain them from it. They took the war into their own management against our advice. Now they have lost their war; we have not. The war ceased to be ours some years ago. Now you are guiltless, kel&#x2019;ein. You may justly reckon so. There is simply nothing further that can be done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There was something once that might have been done,&#x201d; Pasev insisted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Sen attempted many times to reason with the masters. We offered our services and our advice according to the ancient treaty. We could not&#x2014;&#x201d; Sathell heard the footsteps of the youth downstairs as he spoke, and the disturbance disrupted his train of thought. He glanced hallward involuntarily as the door downstairs slammed with great violence. The sound echoed throughout all the House. He cast the Kel a look of distress. &#x201c;Should not one of you at least go speak with him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eddan shrugged, embarrassed in his authority. Sathell knew it. He presumed on kinship and friendship and stepped far out of bounds with Eddan when he made that protest. He loved Niun; they all did. But the autonomy of the Kel, even misguided, was sacred regarding the discipline of its members. Only the Mother could interfere within Eddan&#x2019;s province.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Niun has some small cause, do you not think?&#x201d; asked Eddan quietly. &#x201c;He has trained all his life toward this war. He is not a child of the old way, as we are; and now he cannot enter into the new either. You have taken something from him. What do you expect him to do, sen Sathell?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sathell bowed his head, unable to dispute with Eddan in the matter, recognizing the truth in it, trying to see things as a young kel&#x2019;en might see them. One could not explain to the Kel, could not refute them in debate nor expect foresight of them: children of a day, the kel&#x2019;ein, brief and passionate, without yesterday and without tomorrow. Their ignorance was the price they paid for their freedom to leave the House and go among tsi&#x2019;mri; and they knew their place. If a sen&#x2019;en challenged them to reason, they must simply bow the head in their turn and r...</p><h2>The Retreat of Western Liberalism</h2><p>From <i>Financial Times</i> chief US columnist and commentator Edward Luce, <i>The Retreat of Western Liberalism</i> offers a sharp and insightful look at why the values the West has long championed are now in danger, with a new afterword for the paperback.<p> Luce argues that today&#x2019;s the erosion of middle-class incomes has eaten away at liberal democratic consensus, resulting in today&#x2019;s crisis. We are continuing on a menacing trajectory brought about by ignorance of what it took to build the West, arrogance towards society&#x2019;s economic losers, and complacency about our system&#x2019;s durability&#x2015;attitudes that have been emerging since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Unless the West can rekindle an economy that produces gains for the majority of its people, its political liberties may be doomed. The West&#x2019;s quasi-religious faith in the linear progression of history teaches us to take democracy for granted. Reality tells us something troublingly different. The most mortal threat to the Western idea of progress comes from within.</p><p> Combining on-the-ground reporting with intelligent synthesis of the literature and economic analysis, Luce makes a powerful statement about the weakening of Western hegemony and gives a forward-thinking analysis of what those who believe in enlightenment values must do to defend them from the multiple onslaughts they face in the coming years.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2017:</strong> Why does it feel like things are coming apart in the world? As the U.S. commentator for the <em>Financial Times</em>, Edward Luce is in a good position to observe global trends and answer this question. In <em>The Retreat of Western Liberalism</em>, he points to the rise in populism across nations and the relative economic growth of a few developing countries like China and India as key contributing factors. Of course it&#x2019;s much more complicated than that, and Luce&#x2019;s taut and satisfying book goes a long way in helping us to wrap our heads around what&#x2019;s happening. Think of this as a global <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>. You may not find every answer you&#x2019;re looking for, but you&#x2019;ll make serious, welcome progress in understanding the questions. <em>--Chris Schluep, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Edward Luce</b> is a graduate from Oxford University in Politics, Philosophy and Economics.

Like its predecessor, <i>The Hamlet</i>, and its successor, <i>The Mansion, The Town</i> is completely self-contained, but it gains resonance from being read with the other two. The story of Flem Snopes&#x2019;s ruthless struggle to take over the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, the book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and profundity.</p></p><p>William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.Chapter 1<br><br>Charles Mallison<br><br>I wasn't born yet so it was Cousin Gowan who was there and big enough to see and remember and tell me afterward when I was big enough for it to make sense. That is, it was Cousin Gowan plus Uncle Gavin or maybe Uncle Gavin rather plus Cousin Gowan. He-Cousin Gowan-was thirteen. His grandfather was Grandfather's brother so by the time it got down to us, he and I didn't know what cousin to each other we were. So he just called all of us except Grandfather 'cousin' and all of us except Grandfather called him 'cousin' and let it go at that.<br><br>They lived in Washington, where his father worked for the State Department, and all of a sudden the State Department sent his father to China or India or some far place, to be gone two years; and his mother was going too so they sent Gowan down to stay with us and go to school in Jefferson until they got back. 'Us' was Grandfather and Mother and Father and Uncle Gavin then. So this is what Gowan knew about it until I got born and big enough to know about it too. So when I say 'we' and 'we thought' what I mean is Jefferson and what Jefferson thought.<br><br>At first we thought that the water tank was only Flem Snopes's monument. We didn't know any better then. It wasn't until afterward that we realised that that object low on the sky above Jefferson, Mississippi, wasn't a monument at all. It was a footprint.<br><br>One day one summer he drove up the southeast road into town in a two- mule wagon containing his wife and baby and a small assortment of house-furnishings. The next day he was behind the counter of a small back-alley restaurant which belonged to V. K. Ratliff. That is, Ratliff owned it with a partner, since he-Ratliff-had to spend most of his time in his buckboard (this was before he owned the Model T Ford) about the county with his demonstrator sewing machine for which he was the agent. That is, we thought Ratliff was still the other partner until we saw the stranger in the other greasy apron behind the counter- a squat uncommunicative man with a neat minute bow tie and opaque eyes and a sudden little hooked nose like the beak of a small hawk; a week after that, Snopes had set up a canvas tent behind the restaurant and he and his wife and baby were living in it. And that was when Ratliff told Uncle Gavin:<br><br>"Just give him time. Give him six months and he'll have Grover Cleveland" (Grover Cleveland Winbush was the partner) "out of that caf� too."<br><br>That was the first summer, the first Summer of the Snopes, Uncle Gavin called it. He was in Harvard now, working for his M.A. After that he was going to the University of Mississippi law school to get ready to be Grandfather's partner. But already he was spending the vacations helping Grandfather be City Attorney; he had barely seen Mrs Snopes yet so he not only didn't know he would ever go to Germany to enter Heidelberg University, he didn't even know yet that he would ever want to: only to talk about going there someday as a nice idea to keep in mind or to talk about.<br><br>He and Ratliff talked together a lot. Because although Ratliff had never been to school anywhere much and spent his time travelling about our county selling sewing machines (or selling or swapping or trading anything else for that matter), he and Uncle Gavin were both interested in people-or so Uncle Gavin said. Because what I always thought they were mainly interested in was curiosity. Until this time, that is. Because this time it had already gone a good deal further than just curiosity. This time it was alarm.<br><br>Ratliff was how we first began to learn about Snopes. Or rather, Snopeses. No, that's wrong: there had been a Snopes in Colonel Sartoris's cavalry command in 1864-in that part of it whose occupation had been raiding Yankee picket-lines for horses. Only this time it was a Confederate picket which caught him-that Snopes-raiding a Confederate horse-line and, it was believed, hung him. Which was evidently wrong too, since (Ratliff told Uncle Gavin) about ten years ago Flem and an old man who seemed to be his father appeared suddenly from nowhere one day and rented a little farm from Mr Will Varner who just about owned the whole settlement and district called Frenchman's Bend about twenty miles from Jefferson. It was a farm so poor and small and already wornout that only the most trifling farmer would undertake it, and even they stayed only one year. Yet Ab and Flem rented it and evidently (this is Ratliff) he or Flem or both of them together found it&#x2014;<br><br>"Found what?" Uncle Gavin said.<br><br>"I dont know," Ratliff said. "Whatever it was Uncle Billy and Jody had buried out there and thought was safe."-because that winter Flem was the clerk in Uncle Billy's store. And what they found on that farm must have been a good one, or maybe they didn't even need it anymore; maybe Flem found something else the Varners thought was hidden and safe under the counter of the store itself. Because in another year old Ab had moved into Frenchman's Bend to live with his son and another Snopes had appeared from somewhere to take over the rented farm; and in two years more still another Snopes was the official smith in Mr Varner's blacksmith shop. So there were as many Snopeses in Frenchman's Bend as there were Varners; and five years after that, which was the year Flem moved to Jefferson, there were even more Snopeses than Varners because one Varner was married to a Snopes and was nursing another small Snopes at her breast.<br><br>Because what Flem found that last time was inside Uncle Billy's house. She was his only daughter and youngest child, not just a local belle but a belle throughout that whole section. Nor was it just because of old Will's land and money. Because I saw her too and I knew what it was too, even if she was grown and married and with a child older than I was and I only eleven and twelve and thirteen. ("Oh ay," Uncle Gavin said. "Even at twelve dont think you are the first man ever chewed his bitter thumbs for that like reason such as her.") She wasn't too big, heroic, what they call Junoesque. It was that there was just too much of what she was for any just one human female package to contain and hold: too much of white, too much of female, too much of maybe just glory, I dont know: so that at first sight of her you felt a kind of shock of gratitude just for being alive and being male at the same instant with her in space and time, and then in the next second and forever after<br><br>a kind of despair because you knew that there never would<br><br>be enough of any one male to match and hold and deserve<br><br>her; grief forever after because forever after nothing less would ever do.<br><br>That was what he found this time. One day, according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that Flem Snopes and Eula Varner had driven across the line into the next county the night before and bought a license and got married; the same day, still according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that three young men, three of Eula's old suitors, had left the country suddenly by night too, for Texas it was said, or anyway west, far enough west to be longer than Uncle Billy or Jody Varner could have reached if they had needed to try. Then a month later Flem and Eula also departed for Texas (that bourne, Uncle Gavin said, in our time for the implicated the insolvent or the merely hopeful), to return the next summer with a girl baby a little larger than you would have expected at only three months&#x2014;<br><br>"And the horses," Uncle Gavin said. Because we did know about that, mainly because Flem Snopes had not been the first to import them. Every year or so someone brought into the county a string of wild unbroken plains ponies from somewhere in the west and auctioned them off. This time the ponies arrived, in the charge of a man who was obviously from Texas, at the same time that Mr and Mrs Snopes returned home from that state. This string however seemed to be uncommonly wild, since the resultant scattering of the untamed and untameable calico-splotched animals covered not just Frenchman's Bend but the whole east half of the county too. Though even to the last, no one ever definitely connected Snopes with their ownership. "No no," Uncle Gavin said. "You were not one of the three that ran from the smell of Will Varner's shotgun. And dont tell me Flem Snopes traded you one of those horses for your half of that restaurant because I wont believe it. What was it?"<br><br>Ratliff sat there with his bland brown smoothly-shaven face and his neat tieless blue shirt and his shrewd intelligent gentle eyes not quite looking at Uncle Gavin. "It was that old house," he said. Uncle Gavin waited. "The Old Frenchman place." Uncle Gavin waited. "That buried money." Then Uncle Gavin understood: not an old pre-Civil War plantation house in all Mississippi or the South either but had its legend of the money and plate buried in the flower garden from Yankee raiders;-in this particular case, the ruined mansion which in the old time had dominated and bequeathed its name to the whole section known as Frenchman's Bend, which the Varners now owned. "It was Henry Armstid's fault, trying to get even with Flem for that horse that Texas man sold him that broke his leg. No," Ratliff said, "it was me too as much as anybody else, as any of us. To figger out what Flem was doing owning that old place that anybody could see wasn't worth nothing. I dont mean why Flem bought it. I mean, why he even taken it when Uncle Billy give it to him and Eula for a wedding gift. So when Henry taken to following and watching Flem and finally caught him that night digging in that old flower garden, I dont reckon Henry had to persuade me very hard to go back the next night and watch Flem digging myself."<br><br>"So when Flem finally quit digging and went away, you and Henry crawled out of the bushes and dug too," Uncle Gavin said. "And found it. Some of it. Enough of it. Just exactly barely enough of it for you to hardly wait for daylight to swap Flem Snopes your half of that restaurant for your half of the Old Frenchman place. How much longer did you and Henry dig before you quit?"<br><br>"I quit after the second night," Ratliff said. "That was when I finally thought to look at the money."<br><br>"All right," Uncle Gavin said. "The money."<br><br>"They was silver dollars me and Henry dug up. Some of them was pretty old. One of Henry's was minted almost twenty years ago."<br><br>"A salted goldmine," Uncle Gavin said. "One of the oldest tricks in the world, yet you fell for it. Not Henry Armstid: you."<br><br>"Yes," Ratliff said. "Almost as old as that handkerchief Eula Varner dropped. Almost as old as Uncle Billy Varner's shotgun." That was what he said then. Because another year had passed when he stopped Uncle Gavin on the street and said, "With the court's permission, Lawyer, I would like to take a exception. I want to change that-ere to 'still'."<br><br>"Change what-ere to 'still'?" Uncle Gavin said.<br><br>"Last year I said 'That handkerchief Miz Flem Snopes dropped'. I want to change that 'dropped' to 'still dropping'. They's one feller I know still following it."<br><br>Because in six months Snopes had not only eliminated the partner from the restaurant, Snopes himself was out of it, replaced behind the greasy counter and in the canvas tent too by another Snopes accreted in from Frenchman's Bend into the vacuum behind the first one's next advancement by that same sort of osmosis by which, according to Ratliff, they had covered Frenchman's Bend, the chain unbroken, every Snopes in Frenchman's Bend moving up one step, leaving that last slot at the bottom open for the next Snopes to appear from nowhere and fill, which without doubt he had already done though Ratliff had not yet had time to go out there and see.<br><br>And now Flem and his wife lived in a small rented house in a back street near the edge of town, and Flem was now superintendent of the town power-plant which pumped the water and produced the electricity. Our outrage was primarily shock; shock not that Flem had the job, we had not got that far yet, but shock that we had not known until now that the job existed; that there was such a position in Jefferson as superintendent of the power-plant. Because the plant-the boilers and the engines which ran the pump and dynamo-was operated by an old saw mill engineer named Harker, and the dynamos and the electric wiring which covered the town were cared for by a private electrician who worked on a retainer from the town;-a condition which had been completely satisfactory ever since running water and electricity first came to Jefferson. Yet suddenly and without warning, we needed a superintendent for it. And as suddenly and simultaneously and with that same absence of warning, a country man who had not been in town two years now and (we assumed) had probably never seen an electric light until that first night two years ago when he drove in, was that superintendent.<br><br>That was the only shock. It wasn't that the country man was Flem Snopes. Because we had all seen Mrs Snopes by now, what few times we did see her which was usually behind the counter in the restaurant in another greasy apron, frying the hamburgers and eggs and ham and the tough pieces of steak on the grease-crusted kerosene griddle, or maybe once a week on the Square, always alone; not, as far as we knew, going anywhere: just moving, walking in that aura of decorum and modesty and solitariness ten times more immodest and a hundred times more disturbing than one of the bathing suits young women would begin to wear about 1920 or so, as if in the second just before you looked, her garments had managed in one last frantic pell mell scurry to overtake and cover her. Though only for a moment because in the next one, if only you followed long enough, they would wilt and fail from that mere plain and simple striding which would shred them away like the wheel of a constellation through a wisp and cling of trivial scud.</p><h2>NIMBAL Therapy</h2><p><p>Each year thousands of kids and adults are diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the form of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The incidence of IBD continues to rise, and a major culprit is our food environment. Our diets affect our fecal microbiome, the trillions of bacteria that naturally reside in our digestive tract. What we eat changes the type of bacteria within the microbiome and can cause them to get out of balance and trigger our immune system to attack our bowels. But nutrition and diet are frequently overlooked in medicine and science. </p><p>Nutrition in Immune Balance (NIMBAL) therapy is a standardized method to incorporate dietary therapy into the current medical paradigm.

A magnet for the best and the brightest, its ranks included Cold War luminaries such as Albert Wohlstetter, Bernard Brodie, and Herman Kahn, who arguably saved us from nuclear annihilation and unquestionably created Eisenhower&#x2019;s "military-industrial complex." In the Kennedy era, RAND analysts and their theories of rational warfare steered our conduct in Vietnam. Those same theories drove our invasion of Iraq forty-five years later, championed by RAND affiliated actors such as Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, and Zalmay Khalilzad. But RAND&#x2019;s greatest contribution might be its least known: rational choice theory, a model explaining all human behavior through self-interest. Through it RAND sparked the Reagan-led transformation of our social and economic system but also unleashed a resurgence of precisely the forces whose existence it denied -- religion, patriotism, tribalism.<br><br>With Soldiers of Reason, Alex Abella has rewritten the history of America&#x2019;s last half century and cast a new light on our problematic present.</p><p>ALEX ABELLA is the coauthor, with Scott Gordon, of Shadow Enemies: Hitler&#x2019;s Secret Terrorist Plot Against the United States and the author of four novels.

He was one of only nine people ever to earn the rank of five-star general and the only one with that rank in the Air Force. He had received his military pilot license in 1912, and since then had pushed for an Air Force independent of the Army; he never wavered in his conviction of the usefulness of maximum destructive power in combat. On hearing doubts on the legitimacy of the Allied fire bombing in Dresden, Germany, Arnold wrote, "We must not get soft. War must be destructive and to a certain extent inhuman and ruthless."1<p></p><p></p>General Arnold had welcomed the development and deployment of nuclear bombs especially since it had fallen to the Army Air Force to deliver, and thus control, that mightiest of weapons. (By 1947 President Truman would cleave the Air Force from its Army concatenation, setting up both services as rivals for the Pentagon&#x2019;s largesse.) But Arnold was concerned that the amazing concentration of scientific minds that had made possible the Manhattan Project would prove hard to duplicate under peacetime conditions.<p></p><p></p>Washington had recruited talent from far and wide for its crusade against the Axis. The production capabilities and sheer output of the country&#x2019;s industries (General Motors, Ford, U.S. Steel, General Electric) had been harnessed by the best and the brightest minds from the country&#x2019;s top scientific research centers (MIT, Princeton, Columbia), giving the world radar, jet fighters, the atom bomb. In the span of four years, the country had grown from a second-rate power to the greatest military behemoth in history. It was the dawn of the American New Order. Like ancient Athens and her league, it would be an empire of the willing America&#x2019;s allies willed her to rule the world and rule the world she would.<p></p><p></p>Yet now that the battle was won, the unlikely alliance that had guided the United States to victory was splitting apart. Businesses wanted to make money and scientists wanted to do research. Few wanted to put up with the military&#x2019;s restrictions and low pay. General Arnold feared that if everybody went back to industry or academia, America&#x2019;s enemies could one day hold sway. The likeliest adversary: our erstwhile wartime ally, the Soviet Union.<p></p><p></p>Already in March 1946, former British prime minister Winston Churchill had warned about an Iron Curtain descending on Europe.2 Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had shattered his wartime alliance with the United States, and his troops, firmly in control of Central and Eastern Europe, were pressuring Italy and France. Soviet boots seemed ready to crush all political opposition; it was only a matter of time before a major American-Soviet conflict developed. That was why Arnold was flying to California, to find a way to hire the best brains in the country, put them together in a space they could call their own, and have them come up with weapons nobody had ever imagined.<p></p><p></p>Even in the midst of the war, a year earlier, Arnold had requested his chief scientific adviser, a colorful Hungarian named Theodore von K�rm�n (who was also director of the Guggenheim Laboratories), to devise a plan to entice scientists to continue working for the Air Force during peacetime. K�rm�n had come up with a report called "Toward New Horizons," which called for the establishment of a new kind of scientific community, "a nucleus for scientific groups such as those which successfully assisted in the command and staff work in the field during the war," a university without students and with the Air Force as its only client.3 In other words, a prototype for the organization that would become RAND. Arnold had been delighted with the plan, but the exigencies of the war had made him put it aside until the right moment. That moment came when lean, steely-jawed, blue-eyed former test pilot Franklin R. Collbohm, visiting from California, came into Arnold&#x2019;s office one day in September of 1945.<p></p><p></p>A fanatically fit former marine, Collbohm swam in his pool every morning, rain or shine, before going to work.4 He had fled his childhood environs in upstate New York for the wide skies and opportunities of the West as soon as he could, eventually becoming the right-hand man of Donald Douglas, head of Douglas Aircraft, America&#x2019;s largest airplane manufacturer, and the special assistant to Arthur E. Raymond, the company&#x2019;s vice president and head of engineering.<p></p><p></p>Arnold and Collbohm had met in 1942, when Collbohm procured nascent radar technology being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the Army Air Force.5 Both men shared a passion for aircraft and a deep love for the armed forces, to the point that they might have been inverse images of each other Arnold advocating for scientists among the military and Collbohm standing up for the Air Force among the intelligentsia.<p></p><p></p>Like Arnold, Collbohm was concerned with the imminent dispersal of the best brains the United States could hire, and had approached a number of officials in Washington, D.C., about finding a way to retain top scientists after the war, with little success. When he finally came to Arnold&#x2019;s office, though, Collbohm did not even have to finish describing his idea for setting up an advisory group of independent scientists consulting for the military before the general slapped his desk and exclaimed, "I know just what you&#x2019;re going to tell me. It&#x2019;s the most important thing we can do." He told Collbohm to call Douglas right away to enlist his cooperation; they were to meet at California&#x2019;s Hamilton Air Force Base in two days. Collbohm was to have a list of all the things required to make the project come to fruition the men, the machines, the money.6<p></p><p></p>Collbohm grabbed the first plane he could out of Washington, a B-25 bomber, and landed at Douglas&#x2019;s Santa Monica plant. He gathered all the Douglas officials he needed for the meeting and then looked for a plane to get them to the San Francisco Bay Area. The only aircraft available was President Roosevelt&#x2019;s private plane, a Douglas C-54 dubbed "The Sacred Cow," so Collbohm and his people grabbed that and flew to Hamilton in it, arriving at the base just an hour ahead of Arnold, with barely enough time to round up a luncheon for the meeting.7<p></p><p></p>When the general&#x2019;s B-21 rumbled into Hamilton Air Force Base, waiting for him were Collbohm, Raymond, and Douglas, whose daughter had married Arnold&#x2019;s son. Arnold had brought with him Edward Bowles, a consultant from MIT who had collaborated with Collbohm in setting up the first instance of coordinated civilian and military efforts in wartime planning, the B-29 Special Bombardment Project in 1944.8<p></p><p></p>Lunch was served and the men got to work. One of the chief concerns of the meeting was how the new organization would help develop the technology of long-distance missiles, which Arnold was convinced was the wave of the future. Arnold and his group were adamant that only the Air Force and no other branch of the armed forces should control the new weapon. By the time he finished his coffee, Arnold had pledged $10 million from unspent wartime research money to set up the research group and keep it running independently for a few years. Arthur Raymond suggested the name Project RAND, for research and development. Collbohm nominated himself to head the group while he looked for a permanent director.9 (His temporary stay would eventually stretch to more than twenty years.) And so was RAND conceived.<p></p><p></p>At first, Project RAND had no specific definition of purpose other than the very general outline hashed out in Hamilton Field a civilian outfit to come up with new weapons. But how? Besides long-range missiles, what other kind of weapons? How many? Arnold, Collbohm, Bowles, and Douglas exchanged memos, letters, and suggestions on the future of the organization for months, but final details were not worked out until General Curtis LeMay came into the picture in late December.<p></p><p></p>Gruff, aggressive, demanding, and some would say demented, LeMay was the coldest of the cold warriors. With his bulldog swagger and "never surrender" attitude, he served as a prototype for several generals in the movie <i>Doctor Strangelove</i>, advocating massive attacks on the enemy whichever enemy America happened to be facing at the time, although usually the Soviet Union while chomping on a stogie.10<p></p><p></p>Named Air Force Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development, LeMay included among his responsibilities the supervision of the new research group. Whether purposely or by the sheer serendipity that can accompany government work, LeMay turned out to be the ideal candidate to shepherd the fledgling organization. With typical impatience, he tore through the red tape hindering the birth of RAND at one point gathering all the Air Force bureaucrats needed for budget approval in one room and refusing to let them leave until they signed off on Project RAND&#x2019;s exact mission. Finally, on March 1, 1946, RAND officially was delivered. Its charter was clear: "Project RAND is a continuing program of scientific study and research on the broad subject of air warfare with the object of recommending to the Air Force preferred methods, techniques and instrumentalities for this purpose."11<p></p><p></p>Unlike other government contractors, RAND would be exempt from reporting to a contracting command. Instead, the unfiltered results would be delivered straight to LeMay. LeMay made sure that Project RAND could accept or reject Air Force suggestions for research and that RAND alone would determine the overall balance of its research. In exchange, the Air Force would receive information on intelligence, plans, and programs to optimize the value of its research; nevertheless, the project in no way was meant to exempt the Air Force from its own decision-making responsibilities.12 In other words, RAND would always be subservient to the Air Force when it came to deciding what would get made and how.<p></p><p></p>Arnold, Collbohm, and LeMay proved prescient on the government&#x2019;s need for continued assistance from independent civilian scientists in peacetime. Within a few years, a new mind-set would take hold in government: science, rather than diplomacy, could provide the answers needed to cope with threats to national security especially vis-�-vis the growing Soviet military menace.<p></p><p></p>The United States had demobilized its armed forces after World War II; new weapons, such as the atomic bomb, were seen as cheaper and more efficient than keeping large numbers of soldiers stationed abroad. Rather than nationalize key military industries, as Great Britain and France had done, the U.S. government opted to contract out its scientific research development to private concerns. The private sector, not bound by the procurement and personnel requirements of the Pentagon, could create new weapons faster and cheaper. RAND would be a bridge between the two worlds of military planning and civilian development.13<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Alex Abella<p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

They will make a good book when collected and that will be very good for the <i>Review</i>."--Ernest Hemingway</b></p><p>Since <i>The Paris Review </i>was founded in 1953, it has given us invaluable conversations with the greatest writers of our age, vivid self-portraits that are themselves works of finely crafted literature. From Salman Rushdie's daring rhetorical question "why shouldn't literature provoke?" to Joyce Carol Oates's thrilling comments about her own prolific output, <i>The Paris Review </i>has elicited revelatory and revealing thoughts from our most accomplished novelists, poets, and playwrights. How did Georges Simenon manage to write about six books a year, what was it like for Jan Morris to write as both a man and a woman, what influences moved Ralph Ellison to write <i>Invisible Man</i>? In the pages of <i>The Paris Review</i>, writers give more than simple answers, they offer uncommon candor, depth, and wit in interviews that have become the gold standard of the literary Q&amp;A. With an introduction by Margaret Atwood, this volume brings together another rich, varied crop of literary voices, including Martin Amis, Norman Mailer, Raymond Carver, John Cheever, Harold Pinter, and more. "A colossal literary event," as Gary Shteyngart put it, <i>The Paris Review Interviews, III</i>, is an indespensible teasure of wisdom from the world's literary masters.</p></p><p><p><b><i>The Paris Review</i></b> has published early and important work by Philip Roth, V. S. Naipaul, Jeffrey Eugenides, A. S. Byatt, T. C. Boyle, William T. Vollmann, and many other great writers of the past half century. Some of the magazine's greatest hits have been collected by Picador in <i>The Paris Review Book of People with Problems</i> as well as <i>The Paris Review Book for Planes, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms and The Paris Review Book of Heartbreak, Madness, Sex, Love, Betrayal, Outsiders, Intoxication, War, Whimsy, Horrors, God, Death, Dinner, Baseball, Travels, the Art of Writing, and Everything Else in the World Since 1953.</i></p><p><b>Philip Gourevitch</b> was named editor of <i>The Paris Review</i> in 2005, succeeding George Plimpton, who was editor from 1953 until his death in 2003. </p><p><b>Margaret Atwood </b>has won the Booker Prize, the Giller Prize, and the Governor General's Award, among many other honors.

And they're perfect for the classroom too, from high schools all the way to MFA programs. In fact, I run a whole semester-long creative writing class based on the interviews. How else would I get the world's greatest living writers, living and dead, to come into the classroom with their words of wisdom, folly and fury?

The girl&#x2019;s murder would be the catalyst for an epic saga that to this day holds a singular place in America&#x2019;s collective imagination&#x2014;a saga that would climax in 1915 with the lynching of Leo Frank, the Cornell-educated Jew who was convicted of the murder. The case has been the subject of novels, plays, movies and even musicals, but only now, with the publication of <b>And the Dead Shall Rise</b>, do we have an account that does full justice to the mesmerizing and previously unknown details of one of the most shameful moments in the nation&#x2019;s history.<br><br>In a narrative reminiscent of a nineteenth-century novel, Steve Oney recounts the emerging revelations of the initial criminal investigation, reconstructs from newspaper dispatches (the original trial transcript mysteriously disappeared long ago) the day-to-day intrigue of the courtroom and illuminates how and why an all-white jury convicted Frank largely on the testimony of a black man. Oney chronicles as well the innumerable avenues that the defense pursued in quest of an appeal, the remarkable and heretofore largely ignored campaign conducted by William Randolph Hearst and New York Times publisher Adolph Ochs to exonerate Frank, the last-minute commutation of Frank&#x2019;s death sentence and, most indelibly, the flawlessly executed abduction and brutal lynching of Frank two months after his death sentence was commuted.<br><br><b>And the Dead Shall Rise</b> brings to life a Dickensian cast of characters caught up in the Frank case&#x2014;zealous police investigators intent on protecting their department&#x2019;s reputation, even more zealous private detectives, cynical yet impressionable factory girls, intrepid reporters (including a young Harold Ross), lawyers blinded by their own interests and cowed by the populace&#x2019;s furor. And we meet four astonishing individuals: Jim Conley, who was Frank&#x2019;s confessed &#x201c;accomplice&#x201d; and the state&#x2019;s star witness; William Smith, a determined and idealistic lawyer who brilliantly prepared Conley for the defense&#x2019;s fierce cross-examination and then, a year later, underwent an extraordinary change of heart; Lucille Frank, the martyred wife of the convicted man; and the great populist leader Tom Watson, who manipulated the volatile and lethal outrage of Georgians against the forces of Northern privilege and capital that were seeking to free Frank.<br><br><b>And the Dead Shall Rise</b> also casts long-awaited fresh light on Frank&#x2019;s lynching. No participant was ever indicted, and many went on to prominent careers in state and national politics. Here, for the first time, is the full account of the event&#x2014;including the identities of the influential Georgians who conceived, carried out and covered up the crime. And here as well is the story of the lynching&#x2019;s aftermath, which saw both the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and the evolution of the Anti-Defamation League.<br><br>At once a work of masterful investigative journalism and insightful social history, <b>And the Dead Shall Rise</b> does complete justice to one of history&#x2019;s most repellent and most fascinating moments.</p><p><p><b>Product Description</b></p> <p>In 1913, 13-year-old Mary Phagan was found brutally murdered in the basement of the Atlanta pencil factory where she worked. The factory manager, a college-educated Jew named Leo Frank, was arrested, tried, and convicted in a trial that seized national headlines. When the governor commuted his death sentence, Frank was kidnapped and lynched by a group of prominent local citizens.</p> <p>Steve Oney&#x2019;s acclaimed account re-creates the entire story for the first time, from the police investigations to the gripping trial to the brutal lynching and its aftermath. Oney vividly renders Atlanta, a city enjoying newfound prosperity a half-century after the Civil War, but still rife with barely hidden prejudices and resentments. He introduces a Dickensian pageant of characters, including zealous policemen, intrepid reporters, Frank&#x2019;s martyred wife, and a fiery populist who manipulated local anger at Northern newspapers that pushed for Frank&#x2019;s exoneration. Combining investigative journalism and sweeping social history, this is the definitive account of one of American history&#x2019;s most repellent and most fascinating moments.</p> <p><i>The People v.

He does this by measuring the political content of news, as a way to measure the PQ, or "political quotient" of voters and politicians. </p><p>Among his conclusions are: (i) all mainstream media outlets have a liberal bias; and (ii) while some supposedly conservative outlets&#x2015;such the <i>Washington Times </i>or Fox News' S<i>pecial Report</i>&#x2015;do lean right, their conservative bias is less than the liberal bias of most mainstream outlets. </p><p>Groseclose contends that the general leftward bias of the media has shifted the PQ of the average American by about 20 points, on a scale of 100, the difference between the current political views of the average American, and the political views of the average resident of Orange County, California or Salt Lake County, Utah. With <i>Left Turn </i>readers can easily calculate their own PQ&#x2015;to decide for themselves if the bias exists. This timely, much-needed study brings fact to this often overheated debate.</p></p><p><p>TIM GROSECLOSE is the Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics at UCLA. He has joint appointments in the political science and economics departments. He has held previous faculty appointments at Caltech, Stanford University, Ohio State University, Harvard University, and Carnegie Mellon University</p><b>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; What Are PQs and How Do They Reveal Media Bias?</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>&#x201c;COME ON. POLITICAL</b> science isn&#x2019;t <i>really</i> a science,&#x201d; said my friend Dawson Engler one day, trying to goad me.<br>Engler, one of the country&#x2019;s premier computer scientists, is currently a professor at Stanford, where his specialty is operating systems. He has constructed his own operating system&nbsp;... twice.<br>He is the type of person who succeeds at nearly anything he tries. Born in Yuma, Arizona, during high school he placed second in the &#x201c;Teenage Mr. Arizona&#x201d; bodybuilding contest. After graduating from Arizona State University, he enrolled in the highly prestigious computer-science PhD program at MIT. It is unusual for a PhD student to publish a paper in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Yet Engler published <i>eight</i> while a doctoral student. Shortly after Stanford hired him, for a brief period he dated one of the actresses from <i>Baywatch.</i><br>When Engler goaded me, both of us held positions at MIT, and he knew that my position was in the political-science department. At MIT, which is filled with &#x201c;real&#x201d; scientists and engineers, you often hear quips like Engler&#x2019;s. So when he made it, I was prepared.<br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We can both agree that if you can graph something, then you can describe it mathematically.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Engler.<br>&#x201c;And people, all the time, talk about politicians being left wing or right wing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Engler.<br>&#x201c;And so if a position is left wing or right wing, then you can graph it.... Which means you can describe it mathematically.... Which means it&#x2019;s science.&#x201d;<br>Engler smiled. I don&#x2019;t think I really convinced him, but he didn&#x2019;t goad me any further. At least in my mind, I&#x2019;d won the day&#x2019;s debate.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><b>WITHIN POLITICAL SCIENCE</b> a small industry exists to do the &#x201c;science&#x201d; that I described to Engler: to calculate precise, numerical measurements that describe the liberalness or conservativeness of politicians. In fact, at the time Engler made his quip, I was working on such a project. Indeed, the political quotients that I describe in this book are based on that research.<br>A person&#x2019;s PQ is a number, generally between 0 and 100, that describes how liberal he or she is. I have created a Web site, www.timgroseclose.com/calculate-your-pq, which allows you to compute your own PQ. I have computed PQs for members of Congress by observing their record on roll call votes.<br>By answering the following ten questions,1 you can get a rough approximation of your PQ. When you answer the questions, try to put yourself in the shoes of the members of Congress and decide how you would have voted <i>at the time that the politicians considered the measure.</i> For instance, some people feel that the &#x201c;Cash for Clunkers&#x201d; program was not as successful as they hoped or thought it would be. Accordingly, when you answer the question related to this program&#x2014;as well as when you answer the other questions&#x2014;think about your opinion of the issue <i>when it was considered in Congress,</i> not necessarily about how you feel about it now.<br>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 29, 2009, the Senate passed the SCHIP bill (State Children&#x2019;s Health Insurance Program). The bill would provide matching funds to states for health insurance to families with children. The funds would be limited to families with incomes less than three times the federal poverty level. The cost would be offset by increasing the federal tax on cigarettes from $0.61 to $1.00 a pack.

The act would create a House district for D.C., and simultaneously create an additional House district in Utah. The Utah district would be subject to change or elimination by future censuses. The act would give D.C. one vote in the Electoral College, however it would not give D.C. representation in the Senate.

His amendment, titled &#x201c;Prevention of Mortgage Foreclosures,&#x201d; was sometimes called the &#x201c;cramdown&#x201d; provision. According to the provision, if a homeowner&#x2019;s income was low enough (less than 80 percent of the median income), then a bankruptcy judge could reduce the level of the interest and principle that the home owner owed on a mortgage.

Jerry Lewis, a Republican from California, introduced an amendment to the bill that would bar funds from being used to shut down the Guant�namo Bay prison. The amendment would have acted against an executive order that President Obama had issued to close the facility.

Or, if they emitted less pollutants than their cap, they could sell some of their credits to other producers. The bill set a target of reducing emissions to 83 percent of the 2005 level by the year 2050. The act also included several billions of dollars for incentives for businesses to invest in green technologies.

It provided $2 billion in vouchers to people who traded in an older, less fuel-efficient car and bought a newer, more fuel-efficient car.

His amendment would have barred federal money to be used to pay for an abortion. Further, federal money could not help pay for any health plan that covered abortions. The Democrats opposed the amendment 7&#x2013;52; Republicans favored it 38&#x2013;2. (Technically, the vote was on a motion by Barbara Boxer to table the Nelson amendment.)<br><b>a.

Most important, it would have allowed citizens to order prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies, which often sold the drugs at lower prices than U.S. pharmacies did.

The survival of faith itself is at stake in this thrilling, uncategorizable, wildly inventive first novel--but the adventure is more than one of ideas. As astonishingly as Philip K. Dick and other visionaries of the 1960s new wave, Lafferty turns the conventions of space-opera science fiction upside-down and inside-out. Here are fractured allegories, tales-within-tales, twinkle-in-the-eye surprises, fantastic byways, and alien subjectivities that take one's breath away. Neil Gaiman has described Lafferty "a genius, an oddball, a madman"; Gene Wolfe calls him "our most original writer." <i>Past Master</i>, long-hailed by insiders and now presented in authoritative form, with an introduction by Andrew Ferguson and unpublished omitted passages included in the notes, deserves to perplex and delight a wider audience.</p><p>Born in Neola, Iowa, and raised in Oklahoma, <b>R(aphael) A(loysius) Lafferty </b>(1914-2002) left the University of Tulsa after two years, working as an electrical engineer and occasional newspaperman.

Mahler believes the answers are &#39;Yes!&#39; An indigenous oral tradition still exists in Egypt, he has been able to uncover and study it with the help of a living master of this tradition, Abd&#39;El Hakim Awyan. He has also been given permission to share these teachings -- presented heretofore in fragments by other researchers -- to the Western World, teachings that unfold a whole new understanding of ancient Egypt.</p><p></p><h2>Vintage Style Crochet Projects: 32 Crochet Projects</h2><p>This book contains 32 pretty vintage designs for the home and for your loved ones.

Have you planned one too many wacky activities? Are you frustrated about the size of the youth group? Here&#39;s an approach to ministry that takes youth work seriously. Family-based youth ministry is about adults discipling teens one-on-one and in groups. It is about involving not just the nuclear family but the whole church family--from singles to older adults. More important, it&#39;s about incorporating youth into the life of your church. So stop worrying about the size of your youth group or your budget. Mark DeVries&#39;s refreshing approach to youth ministry will show you how your church can reach today&#39;s teens and how you can keep them involved in the life of the church. Whether you are a parent, a youth pastor or a church member who cares about teens, you will find in this book an entirely different approach to youth ministry that will build mature Christian believers.</p><p>Mark DeVries (MDiv, Princeton Theological Seminary) is the founder of Ministry Architects, a consulting team that assists churches in building sustainable youth ministries. He has served since 1986 as associate pastor for youth and their families at First Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee. He has trained youth workers on five continents and has taught courses or been a guest lecturer at a number of colleges and seminaries. DeVries is the author of <em>Family-Based Youth Ministry</em> and coauthor of <em>The Most Important Year in a Woman's Life/The Most Important Year in a Man's Life,</em> and he has been a contributing writer for <em>Josh McDowell's Youth Ministry Handbook, Starting Right</em> and <em>Reaching a Generation for Christ</em>. In addition, his articles and reviews have been published in a variety of journals and magazines. He and his wife, Susan, have four grown children."Mark is absolutely right in his assessment of the direction youth ministry needs to go in the future. This is definitely one of the most important books on youth ministry that has ever been written." (Wayne Rice, cofounder, Youth Specialties)<br><br>"This is the book we have been waiting for. Mark DeVries brings us a wealth and depth of understanding of the youth culture that few in America can provide. He is taking the necessary step of moving us from 'traditional youth ministry' into a different style of youth work that is desperately needed." (Jim Burns, president, National Institute of Youth Ministry)<br><br>"I appreciate Mark's thoroughness and desire to risk as well as his venture into uncharted territory. Effective youth ministry has always begun in this way. I endorse his premise and support the idea that youth ministry is in a new day requiring new approaches." (Cliff Anderson, Interim Director, Institute for Youth Ministry)<br><br>"Family ministry as a concept is spreading rapidly throughout the youth ministry culture. Mark DeVries's work demonstrates that he has been and will continue to be a pioneer and pacesetter for that movement." (Richard Dunn, Chairman, Department of Youth Ministry, Trinity College)<br><br>"This important book by a seasoned minister to youth argues for a Christian approach to young people by way of families--nuclear and ecclesial--rather than pied pipers. It is thoughtful, suggestive and groundbreaking." (Thomas W. Gillespie, President, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Mark DeVries has given us a very clear and readable rationale for rooting our youth ministry within the family structure. This will be one of those books that youth workers find they must read." (Duffy Robbins, Chairman, Department of Youth Ministry, Eastern College)<br><br>"Mark is candid, honest, realistic, practical and down to earth! <em>Family-Based Youth Ministry</em> is a great resource and a must-read for all youth workers and parents. " (Russell J. Sanche, National Director, KKI Canada, Youth With A Mission)<br><br>"Mark DeVries has done us all a great and necessary favor by thinking through what's for too long been a missing link in youth ministry. When we fail to consider the primary role parents play in the spiritual nurture of their children, we can make the mistake of assuming we can fill that role. <em>Family-Based Youth Ministry</em> will challenge and guide you to build families and stimulate the spiritual growth of students by consciously engaging, rather than ignoring, student's families. I continually point youth workers to this valuable and timely resource." (Walt Mueller, Center for Parent/Youth Understanding)<br><br>"The revised <em>Family-Based Youth Ministry</em> is must reading for pastors and youth workers. The additional insights build from the shoulders of his groundbreaking reframing of youth ministry done a decade ago. In so doing Mark DeVries integrates more than ten years of experimentation and reflection into a cohesive concept of family-based youth ministry." (Mark H. Senter III, Professor of Youth and Educational Ministries, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"Welcome to the book that put family-based youth ministry on the map. Mark DeVries--as only he can do it--points out that the task of nurturing faith belongs to the family, not the youth group, and the sooner the church becomes an 'extended' family for young people, the better chance youth have of becoming mature Christian adults. With the wisdom of a pastor, the insight of a theologian, the sympathy of a parent and the humor of your favorite youth counselor, <em>Family-Based Youth Ministry</em> makes gracious, thoughtful ministry look second-nature. If only we had all read it sooner." (Kenda Creasy Dean, Associate Professor of Youth, Church and Culture, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Director, Tennent School of Christian Education)</p><h2>The Back Page: The Best of Baxter Black from Western Horseman</h2><p><p>For many years, <i>Western Horseman</i> readers have begun their journeys through each issue by, strangely enough, starting at the back. That's because the back page has been occupied by the humorous ramblings of America's best-selling comedic veterinarian, Baxter Black.

Bercot s well-documented findings will surprise many people. Here are just a few of the surprising facts the book reveals: <p> Tobacco saved Jamestown and became the economic basis for many of the Southern states. </p><p> Rum distilleries were one of the main industries of Puritan New England. </p><p> Puritan New England dominated the slave trafficking industry. </p><p> Contrary to what most history books present, the American colonists were the least heavily taxed people in the world. </p><p> During the War of Independence, the revolutionists imprisoned and persecuted the Mennonites, Amish, Brethren, Quakers, and other nonresistant Christians. </p><p> The Founding Fathers deliberately left any mention of God out of the U. S. Constitution. </p><p> Here is the compelling narrative of the founding of America told from a perspective that few people have ever heard. That perspective is the teachings of Jesus. </p><p> Our currency declares, In God We Trust. But did the American colonists truly trust in God in the founding of the United States? </p><p> For example, in the Scriptures, God clearly commands us: Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God. . . . Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due (Rom. 13:1 2,7). Yet, the American colonists to refused to pay their taxes, and they rebelled against their government. </p><p> The American colonists had many admirable traits, and they established a wonderful country. This is not an anti-American book. It is a pro-Jesus book. Bercot firmly believes that Jesus and His kingdom always have to have our ultimate allegiance. And in the pages of this book, Bercot demonstrates that the colonists repeatedly failed to do things God s way. This was true in their treatment of the Indians, in trafficking slaves, in building economies on tobacco and rum, in smuggling, and in refusing to pay their taxes. In short, the colonists lacked the faith to believe that if they did things God s way, everything would work out for the best.</p></p><p>Here is the compelling narrative of the founding of America&#x2014;told from a perspective that few people have ever heard.

The product of nine years of research, In God We Don't Trust challenges much of what most of us learned in school about the founding of America and the American Revolution. Bercot's well-documented findings will surprise many people. At the same time, this timely work will strengthen the convictions of nonresistant, kingdom Christians.In 1985, David Bercot was a successful attorney, practicing title law for the largest public utility in the state of Texas. The thought of ever becoming an author was the farthest thing from his mind. Nevertheless, despite being a career lawyer, Bercot s passion in life was Christ not law. At the time, he was a member of a conservative evangelical church. <p> Although he enjoyed the fellowship at the church he was attending, it seemed to Bercot that some of the doctrines popularly taught by evangelicals such as unconditional eternal security and endorsement of war contradicted the plain words of Scripture. When he questioned various ministers about these matters, he was told that the evangelical teaching on these doctrines was the historical faith. Bercot certainly didn t want to put his own personal interpretations over the historical faith. Yet, he wasn t going to just take other people s word for it that these doctrines were truly the historical faith. </p><p> Bercot realized that the only way he could verify the historical faith was to read all of the existing writings of the early Christians who lived within a century or two of the apostles. So he purchased a set of the <i> Ante-Nicene Fathers </i> (which contain nearly all of the existing writings from Christians who wrote prior to the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325.) During 1985, he cut back his law practice as needed to devote the whole year to reading these ancient writings. These early Christian writings confirmed Bercot s views on eternal security and war. However, he was surprised to learn that most of the early Christian beliefs were different than his own beliefs not only on theology but on lifestyle as well. Yet, when he went back and read the New Testament again, he realized that everything they taught was right there in the New Testament. But his preconceptions had blinded him to the plain language of Scripture. </p><p> Bercot immediately began sharing what he had discovered about the historical faith with various Christian friends. Soon these friends encouraged him to write a book about what he had discovered and how Christianity looked when it was still young. Bercot eventually followed up on their suggestion, and he wrote the book <i> Will the Real Heretics Please Stand Up, </i> which was published in 1989. That book contrasts early Christianity with modern Christianity. </p><p> Since then, Bercot has written a number of other books pertaining to early Christianity, committed Christian discipleship, and American history. He purposefully writes in a reader-friendly, conversational style, eschewing a more academic approach. As he said at one conference, Scholars have had all of this information for centuries, and they have essentially done nothing with it. My goal is to get this information across to the average man or woman in the pews. </p><p> Bercot married Deborah Hart Darragh in 1972. They have three children and make their home in the Amberson Valley in Pennsylvania.</p></p><h2>Montana Before History: 11,000 Years of Hunter-Gatherers in the Rockies and the Plains</h2><p>Dig into Montana&#x2019;s past with this guide to the state&#x2019;s best archaeological sites. A cache north of Livingston, the oldest known evidence of humans in Montana, was left by mammoth hunters more than 11,000 years ago. Their cultural descendents survived in Montana until modern times, hunting game and gathering roots and berries. <i>Montana Before History</i>, organized chronologically from the Paleoindian period to the Late Prehistoric period, details how Montana&#x2019;s early peoples adapted to the rugged environment and several dramatic changes in climate. Learn how they hunted bison and other game before the introduction of the horse, how archaeologists can identify a culture by its projectile point, and where Montana&#x2019;s original hard-rock miners worked their quarries.</p><p>Douglas MacDonald received a PhD in anthropology from Washington State University and now teaches in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Montana. He specializes in prehistoric archaeology, stone tools, and cultural resource management. As a graduate student, he traveled the Great Plains and Rockies looking for stone sources used by prehistoric peoples. While most of the year he lives in Missoula, Montana, with his wife and two kids, during the summer he leads excavations at archaeological sites throughout the state and in Yellowstone National Park.This is a handbook for archaeology buffs and students, fully and attractively illustrated with good color photos and<br>with drawings. After an introductory chapter explaining archaeological practice, stone tools, and the kinds of<br>archaeological sites to be found in Montana, MacDonald (Univ. of Montana) describes in sequence the Paleoindian,<br>Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods and their characteristic sites and artifacts. The final chapter discusses the<br>present First Nations in Montana and the challenges of linking them to archaeological data. The author concludes<br>with stimulating questions. Montana is ecologically very diverse, encompassing archaeologies of its regions related<br>to the Columbia Plateau, the Northern Rockies, Canadian Prairie, and indigenous agricultural towns along the<br>Missouri Valley to the east. That perspective enhances interest in Montana's prehistory. A minor complaint is that<br>MacDonald gives retired Wyoming professor of archaeology George Frison more credit than deserved; Frison pushed<br>his own work, obscuring that of Calgary-trained archaeologists in Montana such as Leslie Davis and John Brumley. <br>Good bibliography, list of sites with standard identification numbers, and a glossary add to the book's usefulness. The<br>price is good, too, especially considering the numerous quality color photos. <br>Summing Up<br>: Recommended. All<br>levels/libraries.-- A. B. Kehoe, emeritus, University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee --Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries<br><br>Finally, we at the Montana State Historic Preservation Office have a book to recommend to readers who ask were to find a good introduction to the archaeology of early human lifeways in Montana.

While he is often unjustly overlooked as a mere adjunct to his more famous brothers Brian and Dennis, Carl was a major international rock star from his early teens.</p><p>The proud owner of one of the greatest voices in popular music--one that graced some of the most important records of the pop era, including 'God Only Knows' and 'Good Vibrations'--Wilson was also one of the first musicians to bring the electric guitar to the forefront of rock'n'roll. His musical skills provided The Beach Boys' entree into the music business, from which he then stewarded their onstage journey through the ups and downs of the 60s to their comeback in the 70s and into the role of 'America's band' in the 80s. Along the way, Carl quietly endured his own battles with obesity, divorce, substance abuse, and ultimately terminal cancer, all the while working to protect his family's business and legacy.

Blessed with an astonishing array of talents, she was at once a mystic, theologian, scientist, doctor, nutritionist, composer, writer, linguist, and artist. Born to a noble family in Mainz, Germany, Hildegard entered a Benedictine monastery and went on to become abbess of a thriving community near Bingen. From a young age she received extraordinary &#x201c;lights&#x201d; or visions of Heaven, which she described in a book called <em>Know the Ways</em> (<em>of God</em>). Hildegard's collection of imaginative music and poetry includes seventy-seven songs for the liturgical year and a morality play, making her the most prolific composer of early music in Europe. Her pioneering scientific work formed the basis for the study of natural history in Germany, while her holistic medical studies helped to provide cures for numerous diseases. Hildegard was also the author of a cookbook recommending nutritional &#x201c;foods of joy&#x201d; and she even invented a new language! Such was Hildegard's fame and influence that bishops, popes, and kings, as well as humble peasants, sought out her wise counsel. Today, Hildegard of Bingen is recognized as a saint and doctor by the Catholic Church and is also revered by many Lutherans and other Protestants.

RUNCORN&nbsp;stood on the rugged headland and stared across the&nbsp;narrow water of the Menai Strait towards the mountains&nbsp;of Snowdonia and mainland Wales, and he&nbsp;wondered why on earth he had chosen to come here,&nbsp;alone in December. The air was hard, ice-edged, and&nbsp;laden with the salt of the sea. Runcorn was a Londoner,&nbsp;used to the rattle of hansom cabs on the cobbles,&nbsp;the gas lamps gleaming in the afternoon dusk.<br><br>&nbsp;Every day he was surrounded by the sing-song voices&nbsp;of costermongers, the cries of news vendors, drivers&nbsp;of every kind of vehicle&#x2014;broughams to drays&#x2014;and&nbsp;the air carried the smell of smoke and manure.&nbsp;This isolated island must be the loneliest place in&nbsp;Britain, all bare hills and hard, bright water, and silence except for the moan of the wind in the grass.<br><br>&nbsp;The black skeleton of the Menai Bridge had a certain&nbsp;grace, but it was a cold elegance, not the low, familiar&nbsp;arches across the Thames. The few lights flickering&nbsp;on in the town of Beaumaris behind him indicated&nbsp;nothing like the vast city he was used to, teeming&nbsp;with the passions, the sorrow, and the dreams of millions.&nbsp;Of course the reason he was here was simple.&nbsp;Runcorn had nowhere else in particular to be for&nbsp;Christmas, no family. He lived alone. He knew many&nbsp;people, but they were colleagues rather than friends.&nbsp;He had earned his promotions until he was now, at&nbsp;fifty, a senior superintendent in the Metropolitan Police,&nbsp;separated by office from those he had once&nbsp;worked beside. But he was not a gentleman, like&nbsp;those of his own rank. He had not the polish, the confidence,&nbsp;the ease of speech and grace of movement&nbsp;that comes with not having to care what people&nbsp;thought of you.&nbsp;<br><br>He smiled to himself as the wind stung his face.&nbsp;Monk, his colleague many years ago, one of his few&nbsp;friends, had not been born a gentleman either, but&nbsp;somehow he had always managed to seem like one.&nbsp;That used to hurt, but it did not anymore. He knew&nbsp;that Monk was human too, and vulnerable. He could&nbsp;make mistakes. And perhaps Runcorn himself was&nbsp;wiser.&nbsp;<br><br>The last case in which they had worked together&nbsp;had been difficult and in the end ugly. Now Runcorn&nbsp;was tired of the city and he was due several weeks of&nbsp;leave. Why not take it somewhere as different as&nbsp;possible? He would refresh his mind away from the&nbsp;familiar and predictable, take long walks in the&nbsp;open, think deeply for a change.&nbsp;<br><br>The sun was sinking in the southwest, shedding&nbsp;brilliant, burning light over the water. The land was&nbsp;dark as the color faded and the headlands jutted&nbsp;purple and black out of the sea. Only the uplands,&nbsp;ribbed pale like crumpled velvet, still caught the last&nbsp;rays of light.&nbsp;<br><br>How long was winter twilight here? Would he&nbsp;soon find himself lost, unable to see the way back to&nbsp;his lodgings? It was bitterly cold already. His feet&nbsp;were numb from standing. Turning, he started to&nbsp;walk towards the east and the darkening sky. What&nbsp;was there to think about? He was good at his job, patient,&nbsp;possibly a little pedestrian. He never had&nbsp;flashes of brilliant intuition, but he got where he&nbsp;needed to. He had succeeded far more than any of&nbsp;the other young men who had started when he had.&nbsp;In fact, his own success had surprised him.&nbsp;<br><br>But was he happy?&nbsp;<br><br>That was a stupid question, as if happiness were&nbsp;something you could own and have for always. He&nbsp;was happy at times, as for example when a case was&nbsp;closed and he knew he had done it well, found a difficult&nbsp;truth and left no doubts to haunt him afterwards,&nbsp;no savage and half-answered questions.&nbsp;<br><br>He was happy when he sat down by the fire at the&nbsp;end of a long day, took the weight off his feet, and ate&nbsp;something really good, like a thick-crusted ham-andegg&nbsp;pie, or hot sausages with mashed potatoes. He&nbsp;liked good music, even classical music sometimes, although&nbsp;he would not admit it, in case people thought&nbsp;he was putting on airs. And he liked dogs. A good dog&nbsp;always made him smile. Was that enough?&nbsp;He could only just see the road at his feet now. He&nbsp;thought about the huge bridge behind him, spanning the whole surge and power of the sea. What about&nbsp;the man who built that? Had he been happy? He&nbsp;had certainly created something to marvel at, and&nbsp;changed the lives of people far into the future.&nbsp;<br><br>Runcorn had untangled a few problems, but had&nbsp;he ever built anything, or did he always use other&nbsp;people&#x2019;s bridges? Where did he go, anyway? No more&nbsp;than home to bed. Tonight it was to be an unfamiliar&nbsp;lodging house. It was comfortable. He would sleep&nbsp;well, he usually did. Certainly it was warm enough,&nbsp;and Mrs. Owen was an agreeable woman, generous&nbsp;in nature.&nbsp;<br><br>The next morning was sharp and cold, but a pale&nbsp;sun struggled over the horizon, milky soft through a&nbsp;fine veil of cloud, which Mrs. Owen assured him&nbsp;would burn off soon. The frost was only a dusting of&nbsp;white here and there, enough to make the hollows&nbsp;stand out on the long, uneven lawn stretching down&nbsp;to the big yew tree.&nbsp;<br><br>Runcorn ate a hearty breakfast, talked with Mrs.&nbsp;Owen for a little while because it was only civil to appear&nbsp;interested as she told him about some of the&nbsp;local places and customs. Afterwards he set out to&nbsp;walk again.&nbsp;<br><br>This time he headed uphill, climbing steadily&nbsp;until nearly midday when he turned and gazed out&nbsp;at a cloudless sky, and a sea shimmering unbroken&nbsp;into the distance.&nbsp;<br><br>He stood there for some time, lost in the enormity&nbsp;of it, then gradually descended. He was on the outskirts&nbsp;of Beaumaris again when he turned a corner&nbsp;in the road and came face-to-face with a tall, slender&nbsp;man of unusual elegance, even in his heavy, winter&nbsp;coat and hat. He was in his mid-thirties, handsome,&nbsp;clean-shaven. They both stopped, staring at each&nbsp;other. The man blinked, uncertain except recognizing&nbsp;Runcorn&#x2019;s face as familiar.&nbsp;<br><br>Runcorn knew him instantly, as if it had been&nbsp;only a week ago they had met. But it was longer than&nbsp;that, much longer. It had been a case of suicide suspected&nbsp;to be a murder. John Barclay had lived in a&nbsp;house backing onto the mews where the body had&nbsp;been found. It was not Barclay whom Runcorn remembered; it was his widowed sister, Melisande&nbsp;Ewart. Even standing here in the middle of this&nbsp;bright, windy road, Runcorn could see her face as&nbsp;clearly as if it were she who were here now, not her&nbsp;arrogant, unhelpful brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Barclay said tensely, stepping around&nbsp;Runcorn as if they had been strangers and walking&nbsp;on up the road, lengthening his stride. But Runcorn&nbsp;had seen the recognition in his face, and the&nbsp;distaste.&nbsp;<br><br>Was Melisande here too? If she was, he might see&nbsp;her, or at least catch a glimpse. Did she still look the&nbsp;same? Was the curve of her hair as soft? The way&nbsp;she smiled and the sadness in her had continued to&nbsp;haunt him in the year since they&#x2019;d last met.&nbsp;<br><br>It was ridiculous for him to think of her still. If&nbsp;she remembered him at all, it would be as a policeman&nbsp;determined to do his job regardless of fear or&nbsp;favor, but with possibly a modicum of kindness. It&nbsp;was her courage, her defiance of her brother Barclay&nbsp;in identifying the corpse and taking the witness&nbsp;stand, that had closed the case. He had always wondered&nbsp;how much that had cost her afterwards in Barclay&#x2019;s displeasure. There had been nothing he could&nbsp;do to help.&nbsp;<br><br>He began walking again, around the bend in the&nbsp;road and past the first house of the village. Was she&nbsp;staying here also? He quickened his step without realizing&nbsp;it. The sun was bright, the frost nothing more&nbsp;than sparkling drops in the grass.&nbsp;<br><br>How could he find out if she was here, without&nbsp;being overeager? He could hardly ask, as if they were&nbsp;social acquaintances. He was a policeman who had&nbsp;investigated a death. It would be pointless to see&nbsp;her, and much too painful. Chastising himself, he&nbsp;thought what a fool he was to have even thought&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;<br><br>He hurried on towards his lodgings, the safety of&nbsp;Mrs. Owen&#x2019;s dining room table and the cheerful conversation&nbsp;of strangers.</p><h2>Concepts of Physics (Part 2)</h2><p>Concepts of Physics explains the different theories and concepts in an easy-to-understand way, making it popular among students.

They became a key element in the formation and self-understanding of the New Left, and have been the subject of continuing controversy. Partly because of their rise to prominence during the political turmoil of the sixties, and partly because they draw on traditions rarely studied in the Anglo-American world, the works of these authors are often misunderstood.<br><br>In this book David Held provides a much-needed introduction to, and evaluation of, critical theory. He is concerned mainly with the thought of the Frankfurt school&#x2015;Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, in particular&#x2015;and with Habermas, one of Europe's leading contemporary thinkers. Several of the major themes considered are critical theory's relation to Marx's critique of the political economy, Freudian psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and the philosophy of history. There is also a discussion of critical theory's substantive contribution to the analysis of capitalism, culture, the family, and the individual, as well as its contribution to epistemology and methodology.<br><br>Held's book will be necessary reading for all concerned with understanding and evaluating one of the most influential intellectual movements of our time.</p><p>In this book David Held provides a much-needed introduction to, and evaluation of, critical theory.

It focuses on President Harry S. Truman&#39;s decision making regarding this most controversial of all his decisions. The book relies on notable archival research, and the best and most recent scholarship on the subject to fashion an incisive overview that is fair and forceful in its judgments. This study addresses a subject that has been much debated among historians, and it confronts head-on the highly disputed claim that the Truman administration practiced &#34;atomic diplomacy.&#34; The book goes beyond its central historical analysis to ask whether it was morally right for the United States to use these terrible weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It also provides a balanced evaluation of the relationship between atomic weapons and the origins of the Cold War.</p><p>This book asks and answers a number of key questions. Why were the atomic bombs used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945? What role did they play in Japan&#39;s surrender? The book also explores the morality of the bombs&#39; use and asks if it was right for the United States to use these powerful weapons.The Reverend Wilson D.

The policies include mass incarceration, sex offender laws, supermax prisons, faith-based prisoner reentry programs, transfer of juveniles to adult court, domestic violence mandatory arrest laws, drug courts, gun laws, community policing, private prisons, and many others. Optimistically, Daniel P. Mears argues that this situation can be changed through systematic incorporation of evaluation research into policy development, monitoring, and assessment. To this end, the book provides a clear and accessible discussion of five types of evaluation - needs, theory, implementation or process, outcome and impact, and cost-efficiency. And it identifies how they can be used both to hold the criminal justice system accountable and to increase the effectiveness of crime control and crime prevention efforts.</p><p>American Criminal Justice Policy examines many of the most prominent criminal justice policies on the American landscape and finds that they fall well short of achieving the accountability and effectiveness that policymakers have advocated and that the public expects but argues that this situation can be changed through systematic incorporation of evaluation research into policy development, monitoring, and assessment.Daniel P.

Written for students and practitioners of massage therapy, physical therapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, sports medicine, athletic training, and fitness instruction, <i>Postural Assessment</i> is a guide to determining muscular or fascial imbalance and whether that imbalance contributes to a patient&#x2019;s or client&#x2019;s pain or dysfunction. </p><p> Jane Johnson, a practicing physiotherapist and sport massage therapist and instructor, breaks down the complex and holistic process of assessing posture into easy-to-assimilate sections. Johnson begins with a discussion of ideal posture and the factors affecting posture as well as how to provide the correct environment for postural assessment, necessary equipment, and the importance of documenting assessment findings. Then she details procedures for executing postural assessments from standing posterior, lateral, and anterior views as well as with the patient or client in a seated position. </p><p> The text features tips for improving assessment technique, and What Your Findings Mean sections provide readers&#x2014;students in particular&#x2014;with guidance for systematic analysis. Each chapter ends with five Quick Questions, with answers, to assist in gauging understanding of the topics covered. </p><p> Information in the text is enhanced with detailed illustrations that offer visual cues to learning postural assessment and identifying anatomical relationships. Line drawings illustrate bony landmarks used in the assessments, and numerous photos show both obvious and subtle postural variations. Reproducible illustrated postural assessment charts in the appendix provide space for recording observations during each step of the assessment. </p><p><i>Postural Assessment</i> can assist practitioners in learning what posture reveals about the relationships among various body parts and in determining whether such relationships cause or contribute to pain or discomfort. As a resource for novices, <i>Postural Assessment</i> offers guidance in observing and identifying common postural forms and interpreting those observations. </p><p><i>Postural Assessment</i> is part of the Hands-On Guides for Therapists series, which features specific tools for assessment and treatment that fall well within the realm of massage therapists but may be useful for other body workers, such as osteopaths and fitness instructors. The guides include full-color instructional photographs, Tips sections that aid in adjusting massage techniques, Client Talk boxes that present ideas for creatively applying techniques for various types of clients, and questions for testing knowledge and skill. </p></p><p><p><b>Jane Johnson, MSc</b>, is co-director of the London Massage Company, England.

To answer this question at the very heart of our sense of ourselves, philosophers have long focused on intentionality and have looked to language as a key to this condition. <i>Making It Explicit</i> is an investigation into the nature of language--the social practices that distinguish us as rational, logical creatures--that revises the very terms of this inquiry. Where accounts of the relation between language and mind have traditionally rested on the concept of representation, this book sets out an alternate approach based on inference, and on a conception of certain kinds of implicit assessment that become explicit in language. <i>Making It Explicit</i> is the first attempt to work out in detail a theory that renders linguistic meaning in terms of use--in short, to explain how semantic content can be conferred on expressions and attitudes that are suitably caught up in social practices.</p><p>At the center of this enterprise is a notion of discursive commitment. Being able to talk--and so in the fullest sense being able to think--is a matter of mastering the practices that govern such commitments, being able to keep track of one's own commitments and those of others. Assessing the pragmatic significance of speech acts is a matter of explaining the explicit in terms of the implicit. As he traces the inferential structure of the social practices within which things can be made conceptually explicit, the author defines the distinctively expressive role of logical vocabulary. This expressive account of language, mind, and logic is, finally, an account of who we are.</p></p><p>Making it Explicit is an investigation into the nature of language - the social practices that distinguish us as rational, logical creatures - that revises the very terms of this inquiry.

This book provides a unified account of homological algebra as it exists today. The historical connection with topology, regular local rings, and semi-simple Lie algebras is also described. The first half of the book takes as its subject the canonical topics in homological algebra: derived functors, Tor and Ext, projective dimensions and spectral sequences. Homology of group and Lie algebras illustrate these topics. Intermingled are less canonical topics, such as the derived inverse limit functor lim1, local cohomology, Galois cohomology, and affine Lie algebras. The last part of the book covers less traditional topics that are a vital part of the modern homological toolkit: simplicial methods, Hochschild and cyclic homology, derived categories and total derived functors.</p><p>The landscape of homological algebra has evolved over the past half-century into a fundamental tool for the working mathematician.

In spite of having been jammed into a small space for hours, with hands and feet bound and mouth taped shut, she was determined to embrace life with all the risks that entailed. For weeks, she&#x2019;d brushed off my concerns about conserving her energy, going out at night alone, and piloting her enormous Buick around the island instead of calling a cab. Good gravy, wasn&#x2019;t she almost eighty-one years old? And besides that, she could barely see over the steering wheel.</p><p>I took a deep breath and lowered my voice so the entire marina wouldn&#x2019;t hear us squabbling on the deck of her houseboat. &#x201c;Your sons will have conniptions if they hear you&#x2019;re driving again,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Lots of things can go wrong&#x2014;the traffic is terrible this time of year&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She gripped my wrist with her tiny fingers. &#x201c;When you look at it without your blinders on, Hayley Snow,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;isn&#x2019;t life just one big series of close calls? We all have to go sometime,&#x201d; she added with an impish tilt to her head. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve realized that I don&#x2019;t want to go feeling any regrets. And I&#x2019;d definitely regret spending the rest of my life acting like a scared old lady.&#x201d; She grinned and patted my hand. &#x201c;My training shift at the cemetery starts at three. You&#x2019;re coming for a tour at four so I can practice, right? How about we compromise and you&#x2019;ll drive me home? That way you can walk over to the cemetery, burn off a few calories, and earn points with your gym trainer,&#x201d; she finished with a sly wink.</p><p>I sighed and nodded my agreement. I&#x2019;d been had and we both knew it.</p><p>She hurried down the dock to her metallic green car and I buried myself in my work in order to avoid watching the big sedan back and fill. When she&#x2019;d extracted the vehicle from its tight parking space, she careened across the Palm Avenue traffic, tires squealing and horn blaring.</p><p>I plugged my ears and tried not to look. I had my own problem to attend to: roughing out a plan for my latest restaurant review roundup, tentatively called &#x201c;Paradise Lunched.&#x201d; My new boss, Palamina Wells, was turning out to be a lot more hands-on than any of us working at <i>Key Zest</i> had expected when she assumed half ownership of the magazine in January. Instead of the cheerleader I&#x2019;d anticipated, she was watching me like a pastry chef eyes salted caramel. Like I might turn on her at any moment.</p><p>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m giving a lot of suggestions right now. I&#x2019;ll back off once I get a handle on things,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told us in a staff meeting yesterday. &#x201c;In the meantime, let&#x2019;s work on making our lead paragraphs truly memorable. Think tweetable, think Buzzfeedable, think Instagram envy. Let&#x2019;s make them irresistibly viral, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Irresistibly viral felt like a lot to ask from an article on lunch.</p><p>At three thirty I put my overworked, underperforming first paragraph aside and told the cats I&#x2019;d be back in an hour, lord willing that Miss Gloria allowed me to drive home. If the lord didn&#x2019;t will that, I couldn&#x2019;t promise anything.</p><p>By the time I fast-walked from Houseboat Row to the Frances Street entrance of the cemetery, I was sweaty and hot, which meant my face had to be its most unattractive tomato red. I took a selfie on my phone and texted it to my trainer, Leigh, as proof of my aerobic exertion. She had been on the money last week when she pointed out that my fitness program had lots of room for improvement. &#x201c;Increasing your walking from zero miles per week to any positive number would be good,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, snapping her iPad shut with a flourish.</p><p>The Key West Cemetery sits in the center of the island on its highest point, where it was moved after the hurricane of 1846 washed the graves and bodies into the Atlantic Ocean. Because of the tight space on this island, many of the burials are now handled in aboveground crypts&#x2014;which makes for an interesting and spooky landscape. That&#x2014;along with some interesting inhabitants&#x2014;makes the cemetery one of the biggest tourist attractions on the island.</p><p>I&#x2019;d put off agreeing to this tour for as long as I could. It&#x2019;s not that cemeteries scare me exactly. It&#x2019;s that the idea of people dying makes me sad, especially people like Miss Gloria, who&#x2019;s probably closer to that transition than most of the people I know. I love her like a grandmother, only more so, because she&#x2019;s a friend, so our relationship is free from the baggage that family relationships can hold. And now here she was, training to be a volunteer guide at the cemetery, where the radio station would play all dead people, all the time.</p><p>She was waiting for me at the gate, positively vibrating with excitement. &#x201c;How much time do we have?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve learned so much, I&#x2019;d like to tell you all of it.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. &#x201c;I have to be at the city commission meeting by six o&#x2019;clock sharp. And I definitely need something to eat before&#x2014;the commissioners have a reputation for running hot and late. So let&#x2019;s say half an hour?&#x201d;</p><p>She straightened her shoulders, the serious expression on her lined face at odds with her cheerful yellow sweatshirt, which featured sweet bunnies nibbling on flowers. &#x201c;In that case, maybe we&#x2019;ll start in the Catholic part of the cemetery, since it&#x2019;s closest.&#x201d; She pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose. The hinge at the left temple, still held together with silver duct tape, caught on a clump of white hair. She had gotten the lens replaced after it was crushed in the scuffle last December, but she refused to spring for new frames. &#x201c;I like old things,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, laughing. &#x201c;They go with me.&#x201d;</p><p>She waved me forward. &#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll start on the right. Then we can work our way around the edges and I won&#x2019;t forget where we left off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long are the tours you&#x2019;ll be giving once you&#x2019;re finished with your training?&#x201d; I mopped my face with my sleeve and paused in the scanty shade of a coconut palm.</p><p>&#x201c;It depends if it&#x2019;s a special event. In that case, I could be here two hours. But most tourists don&#x2019;t have that kind of attention span. They want to see the gravestone that says, &#x2018;I told you I was sick.&#x2019; And maybe the double-murder-suicide grave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The double-murder-suicide?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She nodded enthusiastically. &#x201c;He shot her and then killed himself. And the poor woman is stuck in the same grave site with him for eternity. What&#x2019;s up with that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody with a sick sense of humor made that decision,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Though Eric always says you never know what&#x2019;s going on in a marriage unless you&#x2019;re living in that space. I guess it&#x2019;s possible that she drove him to it?&#x201d; My childhood friend Eric is a psychologist and, besides that, the most sensible man I know.</p><p>She cleared her throat and started to speak in a serious public-radio kind of voice. &#x201c;Okay, in this right-hand corner that runs along Frances and Angela streets you will find the Catholic cemetery.&#x201d; Miss Gloria wove through the mossy stones, pointing out the plot for the Gato family, prominent in cigar-manufacturing days; the English family plot, honoring school principal James English and his father, Nelson, Key West&#x2019;s first and only African American postmaster; and a gravestone reading DEVOTED FAN OF SINGER JULIO IGLESIAS.</p><p>She adjusted her damaged glasses again. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll find something more personal to say than that when my time comes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Definitely,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Miss Gloria, spark plug, wonderful roommate, and mother of fabulous sons. But that&#x2019;s too wordy. How about&#x2014;&#x2018;She was up for anything&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced at my watch, hoping to change the subject. &#x201c;It looks like we have time for one more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I have to show you this one, then,&#x201d; she said, and led me to the grave of Mario Sanchez, an artist who had recorded scenes of early Key West in his folk-art woodcut painting. &#x201c;His artwork&#x2019;s shot up in value. Can you imagine, I had the chance to buy one of his pieces, twenty years ago,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But my husband thought two hundred dollars was out of our price range.&#x201d; She looked up at the sky and shook her fist. &#x201c;Honey, you weren&#x2019;t right about everything. Those paintings are selling for close to a hundred grand now.&#x201d;</p><p>Then she hustled up ahead of me. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s one more&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t it amazing? Their monument looks like a collapsed wedding cake.&#x201d;</p><p>Tiers of cement pocked by dark patches of mildew crumbled from their redbrick base. &#x201c;It was beautiful,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Too bad it&#x2019;s falling into disrepair.&#x201d;</p><p>She waved at two plots side by side, separated by a spiky metal fence. &#x201c;Apparently these two families were feuding. Maybe they bought the plot before they started to fight? But anyway, now they&#x2019;re stuck next to each other for eternity with only this fence to separate them.&#x201d;</p><p>As we headed out of the graveyard to her car, Miss Gloria darted ahead of me so she could slide into the driver&#x2019;s seat. She waved me to the passenger&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;Since I&#x2019;m thinking of driving more often, maybe it&#x2019;s a good idea if you check out my technique.&#x201d;</p><p>Crossing my fingers behind my back, I got into the car and fastened my seat belt. Then I gripped the handle above the door with my right hand and the seat with my left. She looked over at me and laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;I swear it won&#x2019;t be that bad.&#x201d; She put the key in the ignition, turned the car on, and revved up the big engine. We jolted away from the curb on Olivia Street and headed up toward White. At the intersection, cars, bicycles, and scooters roared by in both directions. The town definitely felt busier than usual, but with Miss Gloria at the wheel, all my senses were heightened. She turned on the radio and scooched up the volume so I could barely hear myself worry.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a right here,&#x201d; she yelled over the Beach Boys singing &#x201c;Fun, Fun, Fun,&#x201d; &#x201c;because I&#x2019;m afraid turning left will make you too anxious.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could be correct,&#x201d; I said with a pained smile.</p><p>She drove the few blocks from White to Truman without incident and pulled into the left-turn lane. &#x201c;See now,&#x201d; she said, craning her neck around to look at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m putting on my directional signal. And my hearing is perfectly good, so I&#x2019;m not going to leave it on after I turn like the other old people do.&#x201d; She cackled out loud, but I kept looking straight ahead through the windshield, praying she&#x2019;d get the message and do the same.</p><p>&#x201c;Green arrow!&#x201d; Miss Gloria sang out, more to herself than to me. She piloted the Buick like a boxy Carnival Cruise ship from the left-turn lane onto Truman Avenue and lurched across the intersection to the right lane. &#x201c;What are you working on today?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>I tried to ungrit my teeth and relax my jaw. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an article on lunch,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m planning to include Firefly, and maybe Azur and The Caf�.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about Edel&#x2019;s bistro?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t they serving lunch?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone knows Edel and I are well acquainted after all that publicity,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give her place a rest for a couple months.&#x201d; Edel Waugh had opened a bistro on the Old Town harbor last December. A fire and a murder had almost tanked the restaurant&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been a little too involved in that situation to be considered a disinterested party when it came to restaurant reviews. &#x201c;Besides, she&#x2019;s gotten so popular lately, it&#x2019;s hard to get a table.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus Lord!&#x201d; Miss Gloria yelped and leaned on the horn as a Key West police car cut in front of us. She slammed on the brakes and rolled down her window. &#x201c;Where did you get your license, Kmart?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a cop car,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;Roll up the darn window and keep driving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care who it is. He&#x2019;s driving like a horny high school student late for his date.&#x201d;</p><p>I goggled at her in amazement. As we reached the intersection of Truman and Palm avenues, where another left turn led to our marina, I noticed the flashing of blue lights from the water.</p><p>&#x201c;The cops,&#x201d; said Miss Gloria. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s pull over and see what&#x2019;s happening.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could protest, she had hurtled up onto the sidewalk, thrown the car into park, and scrambled out. A tangle of orange construction webbing floated in the brackish water closest to the new roadway, dotted with assorted trash and a lump of something bigger. Three or four policemen stood on the sidewalk looking down, seeming to discuss how to drag the whole mess ashore. One of them glanced up and then hurried toward us, scowling.</p><p>&#x201c;Get back in the car and keep moving, ladies. This isn&#x2019;t a sideshow. And you&#x2019;re blocking traffic, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; He looked pointedly at my roommate.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; I said, herding Miss Gloria to her sedan. &#x201c;You can watch them from the back deck with the binoculars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I swear, Hayley,&#x201d; she said, twisting around to look again. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;ve snagged a body.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p><i>When I hear politicians say, &#x201c;We need to protect restaurants,&#x201d; I ask: &#x201c;What other business do you need to protect?

While I dressed for the city commission meeting and warmed up some of last night&#x2019;s chicken enchiladas, Miss Gloria hollered in with the play-by-play from the deck.</p><p>In addition to the two sets of flashing blue lights we&#x2019;d seen as we drove by, two more police cars and then a rescue vehicle arrived at the corner. Traffic had backed up in both directions, all the way out to our marina&#x2019;s entrance off Palm Avenue. Miss Gloria spent ten minutes trying to adjust our elderly binoculars, then finally begged me to buzz her over on my scooter so we could rubberneck along with the rest of the locals and tourists and homeless. All the flotsam and jetsam that added up to the population of Key West seemed to be out looking. I was curious, too, but the possibility of seeing another waterlogged body made me utterly queasy.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll read about it in the paper in the morning,&#x201d; I said as I carried plates of food out from the galley. &#x201c;Dinner&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;</p><p>We moved a couple of tomato plants off the bench facing the water and sat down to eat. I&#x2019;d made the green sauce yesterday using a rare cache of tomatillos that I&#x2019;d snagged at the Restaurant Store&#x2019;s monthly Artisan Market last Sunday. After rolling flour tortillas around shredded chicken, onions, peppers, cheese, and sour cream, I dredged them in the sauce and baked them until they bubbled. We&#x2019;d liked them so well, we considered consuming the entire 13 by 9 inch pan between the two of us. In one sitting. Reason had finally prevailed when I remembered my feeble attempt to diet&#x2014;or at least eat smart&#x2014;and, a few beats later...</p></p><h2>Are We Still Rolling?: Studios, Drugs and Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll � One Man&#39;s Journey Recording Classic Albums</h2><p>With never-before-published photos and stories on legendary rock stars, Phill Brown describes the ups and downs of a professional recording studio. &#x201c;In the form of a diary, he takes us through the crazy journey that is making music. His excellent recollections of the excesses of morons and geniuses involved in creating melodies and rhythms for us to enjoy are sheer entertainment.&#x201d; &#x2013; Musician Robert Palmer (from his foreword for the book).<br><br>From the author's first glimpse of a magical recording studio in the mid-1960s up through a busy career that continues to the present day, this rollicking story can only be told by those that were there. As the young tape operator on sessions for The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Joe Cocker at the famed Olympic Sound Studios in London, Phill learned the ropes from experienced engineers and producers such as Glyn Johns and Eddie Kramer. Phill soon worked his way up engineering sessions for Mott the Hoople, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley and many other lendary rockers. He eventually became a freelance engineer/producer and worked with Roxy Music, Go West, Talk Talk, and Robert Plant. <br><br>But more than a recollection of participating in some of the most treasured music of the past 40 years, this is a man's journey through life as Phill struggles to balance his home and family with a job where drug abuse, chaos, rampant egos, greed, lies and the increasingly invasive record business take their toll. It's also a cautionary tale, where long workdays and what once seemed like harmless indulgences become health risks, yet eventually offer a time to reflect back on.</p><p><b>Phill Brown</b>'s (London) career started as a Junior Technician in 1967. Credits include mixing, sound recording and production, notably working in conjunction with British artists such as Talk Talk, Bob Marley. Robert Plant, Steve Winwood, and Dido to name a few.

What brought a well&#x2013;educated young English man to such a state? Was he an outlaw? Was he a thief? No &#x2013; he was a Bible smuggler and a brave one at that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tyndale wanted other English speakers to be able to read God&#x2019;s word in their own language but there were many who tried to put a stop to that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>However, Tyndale&#x2019;s work was God&#x2019;s work and it would not be stopped &#x2013; even after Tyndale&#x2019;s death. One day there was a translation of the Bible in the English language and it lit a fire in people&#x2019;s hearts that would not be put out.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Read and learn about how God wants us to be brave and courageous and to stand up for the truth!</p></p><p>A pastor&#x2019;s daughter and now a pastor&#x2019;s wife, Lori Rich&#x2019;s admiration for the lives of those who sacrificed themselves for the sake of the gospel drove her to write this book, and she looks forward one day to meeting William Tyndale in heaven.

There&#x2019;s war and rumors of war. There&#x2019;s the false recovery of the economy. Failing faith in the US economy is extremely high. Foreign banks have either slowed their purchases of Treasury Bonds or, in a few cases, begun unloading them. We have a current election that is rife with corruption, extreme partisanship and outright fraud. It would appear the left in the country is ready to do about anything to see their candidate elected. While this is very concerning today, what does it mean to the election process as a whole? What will the next one look like? Does anyone believe they will actually improve? Or will the next batters up to the ultimate Homeplate simply make it even worse, take it even further down the rabbit hole? In reality, it matters not who wins. They can only be there for eight years. But the election sets precedent for the next one; and the next one will push the limits even further, if there is one. We&#x2019;ve all heard of the spooky bank holiday. This sort of thing usually happens on a weekend, and on Monday morning you simply cannot access your account. You have no access to your money. Don&#x2019;t think it can happen? Neither did the people of Greece. Or Germany when they were limited to fifty Euros a day. What would you do? Do you keep cash on hand? Do you trust your bank? If you put twenty thousand dollars into the bank and then ask for ten thousand back, you have to fill out forms and justify your need for it. Then they tell the government about it and you face further sanctions. Here in America, we think we&#x2019;re free. Well, we are currently listed as number twenty on the scale of freedom. Think about that. Number twenty! Chile is ahead of us! But we have our guns and all of those other countries don&#x2019;t. And indeed we do, for now. But what if, if, they were to take those away? What do we do then? And before you say you would take to the streets and fight back, think for a minute what that really means. Then watch a few videos on Syria or Ukraine. It&#x2019;s all fun and games until someone puts a tank main-gun round through your house. What follows is just one idea of what this could look like. I&#x2019;m not saying this is the way it would go. It&#x2019;s just some thoughts on it. On how people could act. What the government may do in response and how people might respond in turn.</p><p></p><h2>The Seduction Mystique</h2><p>Please use text on backcover graphic.</p><p>Have you ever noticed the woman who possesses a certain mystique that catches the attention of every man in the room?

You can see the curve of the earth on its surface as it stretches away for miles to the far shore." So begins <i>Old Glory</i>, in which Jonathan Raban recounts his eye-opening descent of the Mississippi River in a 16-foot aluminum motorboat. As the English author explains, his obsession with the subject began with Huckleberry Finn, which he first read as a 7-year-old. And in fact, his opening sentences refer as much to the imaginary river as to the real one, which turns out to be less bucolic than Raban expected. Three miles upstream from Oquawka, Illinois, he's nearly pulverized by a towboat. Later on, the intrepid voyager only just manages to escape a treacherous whirlpool near St. Louis, calming himself afterwards with a generous dose of tobacco and Valium.<p> True, when Raban isn't cheating death he encounters some stunning terrain, which he describes in no-less-stunning prose. Yet <i>Old Glory</i> is much, much more than a travelogue. It is also a brilliant interrogation of the American psyche, in the tradition of De Tocqueville and Crevecoeur. And ultimately, Raban tells us a great deal about the very phenomenon of travel, with all its rigors and rewards, and its peculiar, metaphysical dislocations: "Riding the river, I had seen myself as a sincere traveler, thinking of my voyage not as a holiday but as a scale model of a life. It was different from life in one essential: I would survive it to give an account of its end."</p>"Stunning . . . more successful than 99 percent of the books about America since de Tocqueville." --The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Wonderful. . . .

Begag&#x2019;s moving and often comical account of negotiating a path between the competing cultural spaces encountered during his childhood is a compelling tale of coming of age in a world of ethnic and racial tensions. A story for all ages, it is also very much of the moment, offering unique insights into the reweaving of the social fabric of France in response to growing ethnic diversity.</p><p>Azouz Begag, widely acclaimed as both a novelist and a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), was appointed France&#x2019;s first minister for equal opportunities and was the nation&#x2019;s first cabinet minister of North African immigrant origin in 2005.

A graduate of Northwestern University, she has lived in the Midwest most of her life.*Starred Review* Gillengaria abounds in magic, yet its mystics, the carriers of magic, aren't well regarded. Tolerated in the North by royal order, in the South they're feared, even hated. Lately it appears that organized riders are attacking and murdering mystics. To verify and assess the situation, King Baryn dispatches fire mystic Senneth to the South. With her are foremost King's Rider Tayse; Baryn's shape-changing mystic daughter, Kirra; Kirra's mystic servant, Donnal; scrappy street-urchin-turned-Rider Justin, whose only lost fight was with Tayse; and orphaned Cammon, found serving ale in a tavern, who Senneth suspects is a mystic. They make a tension-filled group, especially because Justin is hostile to mystics and Tayse is uneasy around Senneth. Much of the book concerns their learning to trust and accept one another, and to work together. Pressing deeper into dangerous territory, they hear that the southern king's new, mystic wife has bewitched him, and a moon-goddess cult bent on eradicating mystics is suddenly popular. It's all too clear that, when the 12 ruling houses begin choosing sides, civil war could be the upshot. Clean, elegant prose is, as usual, one of the joys of a Shinn novel, and here it conjures entirely likable major characters and an interesting group-development narrative. Never tripping over the plot twists and complications, Shinn gives us an easy, absorbing, high-quality read sans gratuitous bloodshed and violence. <i>Paula Luedtke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It includes the Biography of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, his mission as a Prophet, his ranking as in the human history. It includes the entire Text of the Holy Qur&#39;an. Its features include - (1) Field Testing the Communication of Divine Message: The unique feature of this translation is its field testing for over 3 1/2 years to improve the communication and understanding of the Divine Message. Translation passages were given to the New Muslim and Non-Muslim high school and college students for reading under the supervision of various Ulema (scholars). After reading, the person was asked to explain as to what he/she understood from the passage. If his/her understanding was the same as is in the Arabic Text of the Holy Qur&#39;an then we concluded that we have been successful in conveying the Divine Message properly. If his/her understanding wa! s different than what the Qur&#39;anic verses were stating, we kept on rewording the translation until those verses were understood properly. It was tremendous patience on part of the participants. May Allah reward them all. (2) Simplicity: In this translation Simple Language and Direct Approach is used for appealing to the common sense of scholars and common people. (3) Understandability: There are no foot notes to refer and no commentary or lengthy explanations to read. All necessary explanations have been incorporated right there in the text with italic type setting to differentiate from the translation of the meanings of Qur&#39;anic Arabic Text. (4) Outline of Pertinent Information: Before the start of each Srah, information relating to its Period of Revelation, Major Issues, Divine Laws and Guidance has been presented as an outline. Then a summary of the preceding events has been tabulated for the reader to understand the historical background to grasp the full meaning of the ! Divine Message. (5) Reviews, Input and Approvals: This proj! ect was started in 1991 and initial draft completed in 1994. Then the Translation was sent to different Ulema (Scholars) in Town and throughout United States for their review and input. After their reviews and input it was sent to Jme Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Egypt, Ummal Qur in Saudi Arabia and International Islamic University in Pakistan for their review, input and approval.

This is a passionate, enthralling book that illuminates what Hitler explainers tell us about Hitler, about the explainers, and about ourselves.</p><p>Debates concerning the historical and moral significance of Adolf Hitler have gone on since the beginning of his rise to power in Germany. In the decades after his bunker suicide, those debates elevated to arguments over the very nature and existence of evil. An integral part of the arguments has been the ongoing attempt to understand the <i>why</i> of Hitler. In this engaging work of literary journalism, Ron Rosenbaum travels the world to converse with some of the historians, philosophers, filmmakers, and others who have attempted to make sense of Hitler's actions, to find a root cause for the Holocaust.<p> Rosenbaum methodically examines the evidence for and against all the major hypotheses concerning the origin of Hitler's character. He sifts through all the rumors--including his alleged Jewish ancestry and what biographer Alan Bullock refers to as "the one-ball business"--and the attempts to derive some psychological cause from them. Various Hitlers emerge: Hitler as con man and brutal gangster, Hitler the unspeakable pervert, Hitler the ladies' man, Hitler as modernist artist working in the medium of evil....</p><p> But Rosenbaum's portrayals of those who would define Hitler are as fascinating as the shifting perspectives on the f�hrer. Here we see the brave journalists of the <i>Munich Post</i> who attempted to reveal Hitler's evil to the world as early as the 1920s. We witness <i>Shoah</i> director Claude Lanzmann's imperious attempts to stifle analysis of Hitler and the Holocaust, branding such historical inquiries as "obscene." We see the effects, on a frazzled Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, of the controversy surrounding the publication of his <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. We see the interior crises of Hitler apologist David Irving and philosopher-novelist George Steiner, among others, as they struggle with the ramifications of their work and thought.

But where did the occupants of the island themselves come from and what do we even mean by &#x201c;Irish&#x201d; in the first place?</p><p>This is the first major attempt to deal with the core issues of how the Irish came into being. J. P. Mallory emphasizes that the Irish did not have a single origin, but are a product of multiple influences that can only be tracked by employing the disciplines of archaeology, genetics, geology, linguistics, and mythology.</p><p>Beginning with the collision that fused the two halves of Ireland together, the book traces Ireland&#x2019;s long journey through space and time to become an island. The origins of its first farmers and their monumental impact on the island is followed by an exploration of how metallurgists in copper, bronze, and iron brought Ireland into increasingly wider orbits of European culture. Assessments of traditional explanations of Irish origins are combined with the very latest genetic research into the biological origins of the Irish.</p> 122 illustrations</p><p>J.P.

It is difficult to know what is important and what is not, and when specific knowledge is vital, or when a more general understanding is sufficient. Tragically often, once the opening is over, a player won&#x2019;t know what plan to follow, or even understand why his pieces are on the squares on which they sit.<br><br>John Watson seeks to help chess-players achieve a more holistic and insightful view of the openings. In his previous books on chess strategy, <i>Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy</i> and <i>Chess Strategy in Action</i>, he explained vital concepts that characterize modern chess. Moreover, he did so in ways that have enabled these ideas to be understood by club players. Here he does likewise for the openings, proceeding from the fundamental ideas that apply to all openings to more advanced concepts that are essential for substantial improvement.<br><br>In this major four-volume work, Watson explains not only the ideas and strategies behind specific openings, but also the interconnections of chess openings taken as a whole. By presenting the common threads that underlie opening play, Watson provides a permanent basis for playing openings of any type.<br><br>This second volume focuses on queen&#x2019;s pawn openings, exploring such openings as the Nimzo-Indian, King&#x2019;s Indian and the entire Queen&#x2019;s Gambit complex, and the characteristic structures to which they lead.<br><br>International Master John Watson is one of the world&#x2019;s most respected writers on chess. His groundbreaking four-volume work on the English Opening firmly established his reputation in the 1980s, and he has produced a string of top-quality works since. In 1999, <i>Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy</i>, Watson&#x2019;s first book for Gambit, won the British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award and the United States Chess Federation Fred Cramer Award for Best Book.

His former pupils include the 1997 World Junior Champion, Tal Shaked.&#x201c;In his introduction, Watson states that his approach to the book has been to start from the ground and work upwards. He certainly does just that, beginning by explaining the fundamental differences between 1 e4 and 1 d4. Some basic yet important principles and nuances, that can take many players a long time and many games to realize are explained within a couple of pages. Already, the reader is being primed to greater understand the elements of his or her repertoire. Watson then moves on to the more &#x2018;meaty&#x2019; part of the book. ... It is authoratively and pleasantly written, which makes reading it not only productive but also very enjoyable.&#x201d; &#x2013; John Lee Shaw, chessgateway.com<br><br>&#x201c;The book has convinced me entirely! Watson has managed to present the most important openings after 1 d4 and analyses them in detail as well as explaining the backgrounds. When he describes the S�misch Variation in the King&#x2019;s Indian in nearly 8 pages you have the feeling you are holding a real classic in your hand. It may sound exaggerated, but I believe Watson is a sort of modern Aron Nimzowitsch. Absolutely recommended!&#x201d; &#x2013; Martin Rieger, freechess.de<br><br>&#x201c;One of the strongest chapters in <i>Mastering the Chess Openings Volume 2</i> is the one on the Queen&#x2019;s Gambit Declined. I particularly liked Watson&#x2019;s treatment of the Exchange variation which he divides into the Carlsbad (Nf3) and Modern (Nge2) variations. Not so long ago White either castled short and played for a minority attack with b4-b5 or castled long and went for a kingside attack. Today add the plan of playing in the center with e3-e4 - sometimes in conjunction with b4 and prophylactic moves like a3 and h3.&#x201d; &#x2013; IM John Donaldson, jeremysilman.com</p><h2>The Ancient World-Wide System: Star Myths of the World, Volume One (Second Edition)</h2><p><p>This completely new edition of Star Myths of the World, Volume One, stands as the definitive guide to the ancient world-wide system of celestial metaphor which forms the foundation for the world's ancient myths, scriptures and sacred stories, from virtually every culture on every inhabited continent and island of our planet.

I&#x2019;m right at the front, being pushed on by the charge of legs all around me, the quick breathing of my schoolmates. We run under the goalposts and swing down close beside the stone wall along the far edge of the field. It&#x2019;s quieter now. I look around. One other boy is just behind me, but the others have all dropped back. Up ahead I can see the fluttering tape marking the next corner. I run on, the cold air in my lungs, the tall poplar trees shivering above my head.<br><br>We go out of the school grounds, along a gravel path that is normally out of bounds. My feet crunch along, the only sound. An old man pushing a bicycle stands to one side as I go by. I follow the tape, back down a steep slope on to the playing fields, back to the finish. I get there long before anyone else and stand waiting in the cold as the other runners come in, collapsing one after the other across the line. I watch them, rolling on their backs, kneeling on the ground, their faces red. I feel strangely elated. It&#x2019;s the first PE class in my new school and we&#x2019;ve all been sent out on a cross-country run. I&#x2019;ve never tried running farther than the length of a football field before, so I&#x2019;m surprised by how easy I find it.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not even breathing hard,&#x201d; the teacher says, holding me up as an example to the others. He tells me to put my hands under my armpits to keep them warm as the other children continue to trail in.<br><br>N M<br><br>A few years later, at age twelve, I break the 800 meters school record on sports day, despite a few of the other boys attempting to bundle me over at the start in an effort to help their friend win. Five minutes later, I run the 1,500 meters and win that, too. When we get home, my dad, sensing some potential talent, suggests that I join the local running club and looks up the number in the telephone directory. I hear him talking to someone on the phone, asking directions. From that point on, a course is set: I am to be a runner.<br><br>It all begins rather inauspiciously one night a few weeks later. I put on my shorts and tracksuit and walk across the bridge to the shopping mall next to our suburban housing estate in Northampton, England, a town of 200,000 people sixty-five miles north of London. The precinct is half deserted, save for a few late shoppers coming out of the giant Tesco supermarket. I head down the escalator to the car park, and then across the road to the unmarked dirt track where the Northampton Phoenix running club meets. It&#x2019;s a cold night and all the runners are crammed into a small doorway in the side of a huge redbrick wall. Inside, the corridor walls are painted bloodred and covered in lewd graffiti. Down the hall are the changing rooms, where men can be heard laughing loudly above the fizz of the showers. I give my name to a lady sitting at a small table.<br><br>Rather than head out onto the track, as I had imagined, I&#x2019;m taken back across the road with a group of children my age, to the shopping mall&#x2019;s delivery area, a stretch of covered road with shuttered loading bays all along one side. The road itself is thick with discharged oil. A man in tights and a yellow running jacket gets us to run from one side of the road to the other, touching the curb each time. Between each sprint he makes us do exercises such as push-ups or jumping jacks. I begin thinking, as I lie back on the cold, hard concrete ready to do some sit-ups, that I&#x2019;ve come to the wrong place. This isn&#x2019;t running. I had imagined groups of lithe athletes hurtling around a track. My dad must have gotten confused and called the wrong club.<br><br>N M<br><br>I&#x2019;m so convinced this isn&#x2019;t the running club that I don&#x2019;t return for another year. When I do, they ask me if I&#x2019;d like to train in &#x201c;the tunnel&#x201d;&#x2014;which I take to mean the shopping mall loading bays&#x2014;or head out for a long run. I opt for the long run and am directed over to a group of about forty people. This is more like it. As we set off along the gravel pathways that wind around the council estates of east Northampton, I feel for the first time the sensation of running in the middle of a group of people. The easy flow of our legs moving below us, the trees, houses, lakes floating by, the people stepping aside, letting us go. Although most of the other runners are older and constantly making jokes, as I drift quietly along, I feel a vague sense of belonging.<br><br>I spend the next six years or so as a committed member of the club, running track or cross-country races most weekends, and training at least twice a week. Much of my formative years I spend out pounding the roads. Even when I grow my hair long and start playing the guitar in a band, I keep on training. The other runners nickname me Bono. One night, when I&#x2019;m about eighteen, I pass a bunch of my school friends coming back from the pub. We are going at full pace in the last mile of a long run. My school friends stare at me open mouthed as I charge by, one shouting, incredulously: &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; as I disappear into the distance.<br><br>N M<br><br>I first become aware of Ken�yan runners sometime in the mid-1980s, around the time I join the running club. They seem to emerge suddenly in large numbers into a running world dominated, in my eyes, by Britain&#x2019;s Steve Cram and the Moroccan Said Aouita. I&#x2019;m a big fan of both of these great rivals. Cram, with his high-stepping, majestic style; and the smaller Aouita, with his grimacing face and rocking shoulders, who is brilliant at every distance&#x2014;from the short, fast 800 meters right up to the 10,000 meters.<br><br>But by the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, it is all Ken�yans, winning every men&#x2019;s middle-distance and long-distance track gold medal except one. What impresses me most about them is the way they run. The conventional wisdom is that the most efficient method, particularly in the longer distances, is to run at an even pace, and most races are run that way. The Ken�yans, however, take a more maverick approach. They are always surging ahead, only to slow down suddenly, or sprinting off at a crazy pace right from the start. I love the way it befuddles the TV commentators, who are constantly predicting that a Ken�yan athlete is going too fast, only to then see him go suddenly even faster.<br><br>I remember watching the 1993 world championship 5,000 meters final on a warm mid-August evening in our living room in Northampton. My mum keeps coming in and out, suggesting I go and sit outside in the garden. It&#x2019;s a lovely evening, but I&#x2019;m glued to the TV. The television cameras are focused on the prerace favorite, the Olympic champion from Morocco, Khalid Skah, and also on a young Ethiopian named Haile Gebrselassie, who won both the 5,000 meters and the 10,000 meters at the world junior championships the year before. The athletes stand side by side at the start line, looking back into the camera. They smile nervously when their names are announced, and give the odd directionless wave.<br><br>The race sets off at a blistering pace, with a succession of African athletes streaking ahead one after the other at the front. Skah, who has taken on and beaten the Ken�yans many times before, tracks their every move, always sitting on the shoulder of the leader. Britain&#x2019;s only runner in the race, Rob Denmark, soon finds himself trailing far behind.<br><br>With seven laps still to go, the BBC television commentator Brendan Foster is feeling the strain just watching. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a vicious race out there,&#x201d; he says. Right on queue, a young Ken�yan, Ismael Kirui, surges to the front and, within a lap, opens up a huge gap of more than 150 feet on everyone else. It&#x2019;s a suicidal move, Foster declares. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s only eighteen and has no real international experience. I think he&#x2019;s got a little carried away.&#x201d; I sit riveted, screaming at the TV as the coverage cuts away to the javelin for a few moments. When it switches back, Kirui is still leading. Lap after lap, Skah and a group of three Ethiopians track him, but they aren&#x2019;t getting any closer. The camera zooms in on Kirui&#x2019;s eyes, staring ahead, wild like a hunted animal as he keeps piling on the pace. &#x201c;This is one savage race,&#x201d; says Foster.<br><br>Kirui is still clear as the bell sounds for the last lap. Down the back straight he sprints for his life, but the three Ethiopians are flying now, closing the gap. With just over 100 meters left, Kirui glances over his shoulder and sees the figure of Gebrselassie closing in on him. For a brief second everything seems to stop. This is the moment, the kill is about to happen. Startled, frantic, Kirui turns back toward the front and urges his exhausted body on again, his tired legs somehow sprinting away down the finishing straight. He crosses the line less than half a second ahead of Gebrselassie, but he has done it. He has won. Battered and bewildered, he sets off on his lap of honor, the Ken�yan flag, once again, held aloft in triumph.<br><br>That evening I head down to the track for a training session with my running club. I try to run like Kirui, staring straight ahead, going as fast as I can right from the start. It&#x2019;s one of the best training sessions I ever have. Usually, if you run too hard at the beginning, you worry about how you&#x2019;ll feel later. You can feel it in your body, the anticipation of the pain to come. Usually it makes you slow down. It&#x2019;s called pacing yourself. But that night I don&#x2019;t care. I want to unshackle myself and run free like a Ken�yan.<br><br>N M<br><br>The night I spend hurtling wide-eyed around the track after watching Ismael Kirui turns out to be one of the last sessions I ever have with my running club. Just over a month later I pack my belongings into my parents&#x2019; car and drive up to Liverpool to begin college. Although I join the college running team, my focus on training is soon lost amid the whirlwind of university life. Like most teenage students, I&#x2019;m unleashed into a new world in which anything seems possible. Running seems to belong in a previous life, although I never completely let go of it.<br><br>The extent to which my training peters out becomes clear by the time the British University cross-country championships come around the following March. The night before the race, I take off on a spontaneous road trip to Wales with three friends, clambering onto the team bus the next morning ready for little else other than sleep. It&#x2019;s a miracle I make it at all.<br><br>A hundred miles away, in the small northern town of Durham, it&#x2019;s a cold, blustery day. I lace up my spikes and go through the familiar routine of jogging and stretching, but once the race starts, my legs, sucked down by the thick mud, give up without a fight. I jog around, unable to rouse myself to run any faster. I finish in 280th position. My good friend and rival from my running days in Northampton, Ciaran Maguire, comes second. Just a few years earlier we battled neck and neck all the way in the county cross-country championships, until he edged past me on the line to win. And now here we are separated by almost three hundred people. I see him after the race. &#x201c;All you need is to give yourself one good year of training,&#x201d; he says consolingly. I nod, but deep down I know it is not going to happen.<br><br>Over the years, I&#x2019;ve met others like me: former runners who still, every now and then, dig out their old sneakers and start lapping the local park in the vague hope of remembering what it felt like. We sign up to a local 10K or half marathon, determined to get back in shape. But something&#x2014;life, an injury, a lack of dedication&#x2014;always gets in the way, and we stop training. But the embers refuse to die, and we refuse to chuck our moldy old sneakers away. We know we might need them again, that the urge to run will return.<br><br>After I have children, it becomes even harder to find the time to train, that is, until I manage to land a freelance job writing race reports for Runner&#x2019;s World magazine. Although it doesn&#x2019;t pay much, it makes the running feel less self-indulgent. It isn&#x2019;t just me doing something for myself in an effort to revive some lost childhood fervor. It is now work.<br><br>With regular assignments from Runner&#x2019;s World, I start training more frequently over the next few years, although with young children it&#x2019;s still hard to get out more than twice a week. I descend the stairs from my office to find Marietta with little Ossian hanging off her hip, struggling to get lunch ready, as my two daughters Lila and Uma are screeching at each other and tussling over a book. The yard is overgrown, the trash needs to be taken out, and the phone is ringing. It&#x2019;s not easy to say, I&#x2019;m just popping out for a long run. See you in an hour or so. So even though I start racing regularly, my times barely improve. I run my first half marathon when I&#x2019;m twenty-nine, in 1 hour 30 minutes. Seven years later I&#x2019;ve run three more in exactly the same time.<br><br>I keep telling myself that one day I will train hard and run really fast. I&#x2019;m not sure what that would mean exactly&#x2014;an under-three-hour marathon, perhaps? But the years are slipping away. Every time an athlete over thirty-five wins a big race on television, I tell myself that there is still hope. It isn&#x2019;t that I want to achieve any specific goal; I just don&#x2019;t want to look back one day and regret that I never gave myself a decent chance to see what I could do.</p><h2>Genital Grinder</h2><p><p>"Think you're hardcore?

In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos. She toasted her loyal readers, whose unflagging interest in her books propelled her sales upward. She toasted her friends and family as well, since they have always been the source of her inspiration. From the very start, her writings have illuminated the everyday dramas of ordinary people. At the age of eight, she self-published her first novel, entitled A Book About Some Bad Kids. Today, she is an international best-selling author, with millions of copies of her books in print in numerous countries.

Grabbing the map, she studied the route highlighted by the counter clerk at Alamo Rent-a-Car. Southwest along the interstate to exit 135-A, State Highway 290 to Farm-to-Market Route 1486, following the little red thread of road to a place few folks had heard of and even fewer were inclined to visit.<br><br>Jessie had followed the directions. Or had she? It was hard to tell, and it had been so long since she'd traveled these forgotten country roads. As she traced a finger over the route, a movement on the road caught her eye. An armadillo.<br><br>She usually only encountered them as roadkill, as though they'd been born that way, with their little dinosaur feet pointed skyward. And yet here was one, waddling across her path like something out of a Steinbeck novel. An omen? A harbinger of doom? Or just another Texas speed bump? She watched the creature wander to the other side of the road and disappear into the low thicket of chaparral.<br><br>An oncoming car crested the steep hill ahead of her. She squinted at the approaching vehicle. A pickup truck, of course. What else did you find out here? As it slowed and then stopped on the opposite shoulder, she felt a slick thrill of danger. She was completely alone, lost in the middle of Texas, miles from civilization.<br><br>The window rolled down. Shading her eyes against the glare, she could make out only the outline of the driver&#x2014;big shoulders, baseball cap&#x2014;and, incongruously, a child's safety seat on the passenger side. A fishing rod lay across the gun rack.<br><br>"Everything all right, ma'am?" he asked. She couldn't get a good look at his face with the sun in her eyes, but that Texas drawl somehow put her at ease, evoking faint memories of lazy days and slow, neighborly smiles.<br><br>"I'm headed for Edenville," she said. "But I think I'm lost."<br><br>"You're almost there," he said, jerking his thumb in the direction he'd come from. "This is the right road. You just haven't gone far enough."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>"No problem, ma'am. You take care now." The pickup truck moved off, backfiring as it headed in the opposite direction.<br><br><em>You take care now. </em>The friendly throwaway admonition lingered as she pulled back onto the road. She fiddled with the radio, finding mostly news and tears-in-my-beer country music. At last she discovered a decent rock station out of Austin and listened to ZZ Top, turned up loud. She hoped the music might drown out her thoughts and maybe even her fears.<br><br>Austin's bedroom communities, with names like Saddle-brook Acres and Rockhurst Estates, were miles behind her, giving way to places with folksier appellations like Two-Dog Ranch. She passed a Texaco station with a hand-lettered sign: We Sell Gas To Anyone In A Glass Container.<br><br>Deep in the hill country, late afternoon settled in. The dark pockets of shadows hidden within the striated sandstone hills were not to be trusted. The waddling armadillo had reminded her that, at any moment, a jackrabbit or mule deer could leap out onto the road. She would hate to hit an animal. She didn't even want to hit a dead one, she realized, swerving to avoid a battered carcass that had not yet been desiccated into a grotesque kite of flattened skin.<br><br>The trip felt much longer than she remembered. Of course, years back, she couldn't wait to leave; now she couldn't wait to get home. Soon she saw it, the weatherbeaten Welcome To Edenville sign with its faded illustration of a peach orchard. Smaller signs sprouted in the field at its feet: The Halfway Baptist Church. Home of the Fighting Serpents. Lions Club meets on the third Saturday each month.<br><br>The tree-shaded town had the eerie familiarity of a half-remembered dream. Hunched-together storefronts lined the main square, which was organized around a blocky, century-old courthouse. Adam's Ribs B-B-Q and Eve's Garden Shoppe still stood side by side across from Roscoe's Hay and Feed and an exhausted Schott's discount outlet. Despite the addition of the Celestial Cyber Cafe, the place retained its midcentury, slow moving character, a town content to lag behind while time sped past like traffic on the interstate bypass.<br><br>Right out of high school, Jessie had left for college. She'd loved Austin's urban bustle and suburban sprawl, its population of politicians, intellectuals, Goths, Mexicans, criminals and rednecks. Now she was back in the small town filled with everything she'd left behind, whether she liked it or not.<br><br>Despite the passage of time, she knew her way now. Five more miles along a narrow lane, past the preternaturally green Woodcreek golf course and driving range, and then a right turn onto the lake road.<br><br>She rolled down all four windows of the car and took a deep breath. She could smell the lake before she saw it&#x2014;mes-quite and cedar and the cleansing scent of air blown across fresh water. One of the few cold, spring-fed lakes in Texas, Eagle Lake was bluer than autumn twilight.<br><br>Areas of rounded rock, with hawthorn shrubs blooming in the cracks, plunged down to touch the water. The lake itself was a vast mirror with a forest fringe of the most extraordinary trees in the state. They called them the lost maples of Eagle Lake because everyone knew this particular type of tree didn't rightly belong in Texas. Maples grew in the long, frozen sleep of winter found only in the woods up north, not the unpredictable fits and starts of brutal cold and blistering heat of the Texas hill country. And yet here they thrived, nonnatives huddled together beside a picture-book lake.<br><br>Legends about the maples abounded. Indian lore held that they were the souls of long-dead ancestors from the North. Others claimed a settler had planted them for his Yankee bride to remind her of the New England autumns she missed so desperately. But all anybody really knew was that the trees were transplanted strangers that didn't belong, yet managed to flourish here anyway, bursting into hectic color after a scorching summer had sucked the pigment from everything else.<br><br>Each autumn, the maples blazed brighter than any forest fire, in colors so intense they made your eyes smart: magenta, gold, deep orange, ocher, burnt umber. For two weeks every fall, the Farm-to-Market Road was clogged with tourists who drove out to Lakeside County Park to take pictures of their kids skipping stones on the leaf-strewn water or climbing high in those God-painted branches.<br><br>As Jessie drew nearer to her destination, she tried to remember when the foliage reached its peak. Early November, she recalled. Homecoming season.<br><br></p><h2>The Power of Capitalism: A Journey Through Recent History Across Five Continents</h2><p>&#x201c;The market has failed, we need more government intervention." That&#x2019;s the mantra politicians, the media, and intellectuals have been reiterating ever since the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis. By taking the reader on a journey across continents and through recent history, Rainer Zitelmann disproves this call for greater government intervention, and demonstrates that capitalism matters more than ever. The author provides compelling evidence from across the world that capitalism has been the solution to a number of massive problems. He compares developments in West and East Germany, North and South Korea, capitalist Chile v. Socialist Venezuela, and analyzes the extraordinary economic rise of China. For many people, "capitalism" is a dirty word. This book provides a timely reminder of capitalism&#x2019;s power in enabling growth and prosperity, and in alleviating poverty.</p><p>Rainer Zitelmann is the author of 19 books, his most recent being <i>The Wealth Elite</i>. He was previously a senior editor at <i>Die Welt</i> newspaper.<p>For many people, the collapse of one socialist regime after another in the late 1980s firmly established market capitalism as the superior system. Nevertheless, anti-capitalist resentment &#x2013; sometimes latent, sometimes expressed openly &#x2013; not only still persists in some quarters but has gained a lot of ground in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Policy makers, media commentators and intellectuals almost unanimously interpret the crisis as a failure of the market, or of the capitalist system, that can only be resolved by more government intervention.</p> <br><br><p>This book was written as a response to these views and was driven by the worry that we are about to disown the foundations on which our economic prosperity is based. For many people, &#x2018;capitalism&#x2019; is a dirty word. Although these negative connotations frequently date back to well before the financial crisis, the proponents of a genuinely free market increasingly and themselves on the receiving end of accusations of &#x2018;market radicalism&#x2019;.</p></p><h2>Lucky Us: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER � <b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE WASHINGTON POST</i> AND <i>O: THE OPRAH MAGAZINE&nbsp;</i>� <b>Look for special features inside.

My mother said we should drive down to his place and see what might be in it for us."--to its sweet tableau of an ending, Amy Bloom&#x2019;s <em>Lucky Us</em> is a percussive novel about two sisters who go from Ohio to Hollywood and back trying both to find and lose themselves and each other. Iris has the disposition (if not the talent) of an actress, but early on she gets drummed out of Tinseltown for a particularly shocking (for the time) youthful indiscretion; Eva is her younger, more dour sister/observer. Through short vignettes of and letters from the Acton sisters as well as a growing cast of tragicomic characters, we get a jazzy novel about the WWII era. Bloom is particularly good at recreating the idioms of the time--in her acknowledgements, she thanks her cousin, the writer/scholar Harold Bloom for teaching her &#x201c;to find a better way to put almost anything.&#x201d;--and both her style and her story have a subversive, iconoclastic quality. This is not a very long novel, but with its expansive understanding of human nature and of history, it covers a lot of ground. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Amy Bloom</b> is the author of <i>Come to Me,</i> a National Book Award finalist; <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,</i> nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award;<i> Love Invents Us;</i> <i>Normal;</i> <i>Away, </i>a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller; and <i>Where the God of Love Hangs Out</i>.

N.D.D., or Nutrition Deficit Disorder, as coined by Dr. Bill Sears, is based on the idea that if "you put junk food into a child's brain, you get back junk behavior and learning." <br><br>Dr. Sears will explore the latest scientific research on the effects of nutrition on the brain. He will present case studies of his own patients who were diagnosed as "N.D.D." and showed major improvement in learning and behavior with diet change. Instead of simply medicating his patients, Dr. Sears looked for a better solution--in fact, with better nutrition, many of his patients were able to greatly reduce or even stop their medication. The book will also provide parents with a prescription, shopping and meal tips, and recipes to make implementing a healthier lifestyle that much easier.<br><br>THE N.D.D.

After growing up in the heart of rural Methodism in Oklahoma, Thomas Oden found Marx, Nietzsche and Freud storming into his imagination. He joined the post-World War II pacifist movement and became enamored with every aspect of the 1950s' ecumenical Student Christian Movement. Ten years before America's entry into the Vietnam war he admired Ho Chi Min as an agrarian patriot. For Oden, every turn was a left turn. At Yale he earned his PhD under H. Richard Niebuhr and later met with some of the most formidable minds of the era&#x2015;enjoying conversations with Gadamer, Bultmann and Pannenberg as well as a lengthy discussion with Karl Barth at a makeshift office in his hospital room. While traveling with his family through Turkey, Syria and Israel, he attended Vatican II as an observer and got his first taste of ancient Christianity. And slowly, he stopped making left turns. Oden's enthusiasms for pacifism, ecumenism and the interface between theology and psychotherapy were ambushed by varied shapes of reality. Yet it was a challenge from a Jewish scholar, his friend and mentor Will Herberg, that precipitated his most dramatic turn&#x2015;back to the great minds of ancient Christianity. Later a meeting with then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Benedict XVI) planted the seeds for what became Oden?s highly influential <em>Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture.</em> This fascinating memoir walks us through not only his personal history but some of the most memorable chapters in twentieth-century theology.</p><p>Thomas C. Oden (PhD, Yale University) is the general editor of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture and the Ancient Christian Doctrine series as well as the author of <em>Classic Christianity</em>, a revision of his three-volume systematic theology. His recent books include <em>The African Memory of Mark, Early Libyan Christianity</em> and <em>How Africa Shaped the Christian Mind</em>. He is the director of the Center for Early African Christianity at Eastern University in Pennsylvania and he formerly served as the Henry Anson Buttz Professor of Theology at the Graduate School and The Theological School of Drew University in Madison, New Jersey."<em>A Change of Heart</em> takes readers where Thomas Oden has been, bringing them into a conversation with some of the seminal theological minds of the 20th century and walking them through the tumultuous decades of Thomas Oden's lifespan. By any measure, these have been some of the most consequential and controversial in the history of the Christian church. More than anything else, this book will help every preacher come to a deeper understanding of what it means to embrace biblical Christianity despite facing a highly secularized age." (R. Albert Mohler Jr., Preaching, "The Year's Best Books for Preachers," March/April 2015)<br><br>". . . I would yet close by stating once again what a delightful and insightful book this is. It is a powerful analysis of a broader phenomenon: the movement from the political left to the right, and from an infatuation with novelty to an appreciation of tradition. . . . Unusual for an autobiography, this is not an exercise in ego but rather the testimony of a remarkably talented and yet touchingly humble man. Oden has lived an extraordinary life at the very center of the revival of church interest in both patristic thought and what he so helpfully characterizes as paleo-orthodoxy." (Carl R. Trueman, First Things, February 2015)<br><br>"Oden provides an engaging account of his life, decade by decade, from the 1930s into the 2010s, as he moves from rural Oklahoma to Dallas and then east to Yale University and Drew University before ultimately returning to Altus, OK. . . . This thoughtful reflection will engage a wide variety of readers and will help promote not only the broadest ecumenical Christianity but also interfaith cooperation." (Carolyn Craft, Library Journal, November 15, 2014)<br><br>"If ever a theologian should provide a memoir of his journey, Tom Oden is the one. <em>A Change of Heart</em> is the record of that phenomenal sojourn intersecting the lives of countless theologians and religious leaders. And as readers of the relentless Oden would expect, the pages of this book fly by on the winds of Oden the wordsmith. This is the montage of a master artist." (Paige Patterson, president, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas)<br><br>"Tom Oden's <em>A Change of Heart</em> chronicles his own odyssey through modernity back home to the fathers he never knew&#x2015;until he read them, prayed with them and learned the riches of the timeless faith at their feet. This book invites readers to join him in this odyssey. As one who has been privileged to travel the last part with him, I can truly say they will not be disappointed in the journey Tom Oden is inviting them to undertake with him." (Joel C. Elowsky, associate professor of historical theology, Concordia Seminary St. Louis; research director, Center for Early African Christianity)<br><br>"In this memoir Tom Oden explores his theological career with specific reference to his transition from Christian liberalism to evangelical Christianity. In the process he describes the many theological issues that dominated his era, focusing on the World Council of Churches as a lightning rod. Oden's view that theology should not be at the whim of every passing fashion, or that current affairs should not be the litmus test, deserves careful consideration even by those who disagree with him. Oden offers a touching description of the passing of his wife after a bout with cancer. The book is a record of an important theological voice of his generation, one that brings to focus the wide-ranging religious influences of the day." (Lamin Sanneh, D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity, Yale Divinity School)<br><br>"Tom Oden is one of the most remarkable Christians of our time. This is the story of how he has lived through, contributed to and helped to overthrow several revolutions during his long and fruitful life. Deeply rooted in Wesleyan spiritual traditions, Oden shows us the meaning of grace in a human life&#x2015;grace that shatters in order to restore and bring joy. Those of us who know and love this great theologian will be delighted to read the story of his pilgrimage thus far. The whole church will be blessed by it." (Timothy George, founding dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University and general editor of the Reformation Commentary on Scripture)<br><br>"In a century when intellectuals abandoned the Christian faith in droves, one intellectual had the courage to embrace it. A movement liberal at forty, at eighty Tom Oden had become the champion of the classic Christian consensus. <em>A Change of Heart </em>tells the story of one of the twentieth century's most courageous intellectual and spiritual journeys." (Roberta Green Ahmanson)<br><br>"Oden's <em>Memoir</em> should be a preferred read for anyone interested in twentieth- and twenty-first-century historical and systematic theology, especially as such work has played out in the halls of modernity, evangelicalism, and ecumenical trends, especially in the context of the unfolding exchanges between Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Evangelical Protestantism." (Woodrow W. Whidden, Andrews University Seminary Studies, Autumn 2016)<br><br>"The ecumenical value of Thomas Oden's life work, especially among Protestants, liberal and conservative, would be hard to overestimate. He is not simply an important figure in the subordination of school and denominational theologies to a catholic vision, but because of his courage in separating himself from error, combined with his titanic labors in support of orthodox Christianity, he is the pivotal figure at a critical theological juncture, an icon of the pilgrim on a pilgrimage that many will and must take, and for which he will be thanked by generations of those who will be served and perhaps even saved by his efforts. John Wesley, his spiritual progenitor, called himself a 'brand plucked from the burning.' So is Thomas Oden, and he has given us here not only and account of the wood hardened by fire, but of the fire itself, which will destroy the souls who commit themselves to it if they are not rescued by a Compassionate Jew."

Based on in-depth life history interviews with African-American, Latina, and lesbian women, her book chronicles the effects of racism, poverty, sexism, acculturation, and sexual abuse on women's bodies and eating patterns.<br>A Hunger So Wide and So Deep dispels popular stereotypes of anorexia and bulimia as symptoms of vanity and underscores the risks of mislabeling what is often a way of coping with society's own disorders. By featuring the creative ways in which women have changed their unwanted eating patterns and regained trust in their bodies and appetites, Thompson offers a message of hope and empowerment that applies across race, class, and sexual preference.</p><p>Becky W. Thompson is a visiting assistant professor of African American studies and sociology at Wesleyan University.In this highly readable account, Thompson (editor of Beyond a Dream Deferred: Multicultural Education and the Politics of Excellence, Univ. of Minnesota Pr., 1993) has broken down the theory that eating disorders are temporary afflictions of the white, middle-class, teenage population. Based on interviews with 18 white, Latina, and African American women, aged 19 to 46, the author found that in one-third to two-thirds of cases, eating disorders were linked to emotional or, more particularly, sexual abuse. These women were seeking control over something in their lives, argues Thompson. Food was more accessible than drugs or alcohol and, unlike substance abuse, binging allowed women to perform their daily lives with a clear head. The author also examines the healing process, detailing these women's experiences with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Overeater's Anonymous (OA), or individual counseling sought out in response to some life crisis. Thompson ends the book with short biographies of the interviewees. Her uniquely balanced view of women with eating disorders is highly recommended for public, academic, and medical libraries.<br><i>Lisa Wise, Univ. of Southern Colorado, Pueblo</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hammer Is the Prayer: Selected Poems</h2><p><p><b>A visionary selection from one of America&#x2019;s foremost poets</b></p><p>One of the most distinctive voices in contemporary American poetry, Christian Wiman has forged a singular style that fuses a vivid and propulsive music with clear-eyed realism, wry humor, and visionary lament. In his &#x201c;daring and urgent&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) memoir, <i>My Bright Abyss</i>, he asks, &#x201c;What is poetry&#x2019;s role when the world is burning?&#x201d; <i>Hammer Is the Prayer: Selected Poems </i>might be read as an answer to that question.</p><p> From the taut forms of his first book to the darker, more jagged fluencies of his second, into the bold and pathbreaking poems of his last two collections, <i>Hammer Is the Prayer </i>bears the reckless, restless interrogations and the slashing lyric intensity that distinguish Wiman&#x2019;s verse. But it also reveals the dramatic and narrative abilities for which he has been widely praised&#x2015;the junkyard man in &#x201c;Five Houses Down&#x201d; with his &#x201c;wonder-cluttered porch&#x201d; and &#x201c;the eyesore opulence / of his five partial cars,&#x201d; or the tragicomic character in &#x201c;Being Serious&#x201d; who suffers &#x201c;the world&#x2019;s idiocy / like a saint its pains.&#x201d; </p><p><i>Hammer Is the Prayer</i> brings together three decades of Wiman&#x2019;s acclaimed poetry. Selected by the author, these poems reveal the singular music and metaphysical urgency that have attracted so many readers to his work and firmly assert his place as one of the most essential poets of our time.</p></p><p><b>Christian Wiman</b> is the author of several books, including a memoir, <i>My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer</i> (FSG, 2013); <i>Every Riven Thing</i> (FSG, 2010), winner of the Ambassador Book Award in poetry; <i>Once in the West</i> (FSG, 2014), a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist in poetry; and <i>Stolen Air: Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam</i>.

From fast-growing denominations such as the Assemblies of God to popular television ministries such as "The 700 Club," the fruits of Pentecostalism can be seen throughout modern Christian life.<br><br>In this landmark study, Donald Dayton explains how Pentecostalism grew out of Methodism and the nineteenth-century holiness revivals. He finds evidence of Wesleyan teaching in the classic writings of many Pentecostal leaders. He shows how Pentecostalism is rooted in the Wesleyan theological tradition, rather than being a contrived system of modern revivalistic ides. Martin E. Marty says in his foreword that Pentecostals "have no choice, it is clear from this book, but to see that there were . . . roots to the growth they reaped." He calls <i>Theological Roots of Pentecostalism</i> "a very important statement . . . one without which subsequent commentators on Pentecostalism are not likely to give intelligent accounts."</p><p><b>Donald W. Dayton</b> is professor of theology and ethics at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in Lombard, Illinois. He received his PhD from the University of Chicago....the clearest of distillations. But what shines through the most is his fairness...his contribution to Pentecostal studies is a 'blessing;' but its value for evangelical historiography is a 'second blessing.' (<i>Church History</i>)<br><br>...An illuminating piece of work that concludes with a highly valuable and extensive bibliographical essay and with three indexes... (<i>Adris Newsletter</i>)<br><br>...A much needed tool. He makes it possible for us to see Pentecostals, so often dismissed as a fringe group, as intimately connected with the so-called mainstream of American religion. (<i>Theology Today</i>)<br><br>...magisterial...should become the standard work on the theological matrix of Pentecostal self-understanding. (<i>Ecumenical Review</i>)<br><br>In applying the methods of historical theology to a movement that has rarely been approached in this manner, the author breaks new ground and suggests a closer relationship of Pentecostalism to Reformed and Wesleyan Protestantism than has sometimes been recognized...Very helpful to scholars and a useful addition to undergraduate and graduate collections of American religious, intellectual, and social history.

As human civilization reached out to colonize the stars, the family led Earth to ally itself with the peaceful alien Mrdini. Together, the two races have held back the predatory Hivers, who once decimated entire worlds.</p><p></p><p><b>THE NEW ORDER</b></p><p></p><p>But there are factions on Earth who resent the power the family has accumulated.

( The first four books in the series are: <i>The Rowan</i>, <i>Damia</i>, <i>Damia's Children</i>, and <i>Lyon's Pride</i>.) As usual, McCaffrey delivers vividly real characters struggling with personal, political, and ethical issues and finding humane solutions.<p> Federated Teleport and Telepath, dominated by the Gwyn-Raven clan, provides interstellar shipping and communications for the Star League of Humans and Mrdinis--weasel-like aliens. In following the aggressive, ant-like Hivers, whose "spheres" have repeatedly attacked League worlds, naval vessels have discovered many more habitable planets, including some occupied by Hivers. Who will get to colonize these planets, Humans or Mrdinis? Should all Hivers be destroyed, or is there some way to contain them? Where will more Talents to staff the vital Towers come from? And how best to defeat those whose resentment of the Gwyn-Raven family's powers and friendship with Mrdinis could lead to violence? </p><p> McCaffrey's protagonists are four Gwyn-Raven grandchildren, now young adults who find romance and mature while studying both alien races. Old and new fans alike can enjoy her masterful blending of scientific extrapolation and fantasy elements to produce a universe they'll leave regretfully. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Granby Presbyterian is a weary congregation without a pastor, overwhelmed by the prospect of finding someone who actually wants to be a pastor&#x2014;not a manager, coach, or CEO.<br><br> When Granby's pastoral search committee and Jonas connect through handwritten letters passed back and forth, something sparks between them&#x2014;something so real and refreshing that even after Jonas and his family move to Granby, he continues the regular practice of writing letters to his congregation.<br><br> Spanning seven years of his ministry at Granby Presbyterian, Jonas's letters ruminate on everything from fly-fishing to the Nicene Creed. They reveal the earthy spirituality woven into the joys and sorrows of the people of Granby, the community of the church, and Jonas's own unfolding story.<br><br> Readers will discover what it means for a pastor and a church to do the slow work of ministry in community&#x2014;anchored by a common place and buoyed by a life of faith that is meaningful, rooted, and true.</p><p><b>Winn Collier</b>&nbsp;is a pastor, columnist, and author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Holy Curiosity</i>.

Despite all technological advances, final mastery of any battlefield depends upon the tight-knit group of footsoldiers trained to manoeuvre, shoot and dig in. This first of a two-part study examines the methods by which the Western infantry of World War II&nbsp;- the German, British and US armies - actually brought their firepower to bear. Drawing upon period training manuals for the evolving theory, and on personal memoirs for the individual practice, this first book covers the organization and tactics of the squad of ten or a dozen men, and the platoon of three or four squads. The text is illustrated with contemporary photographs and diagrams, and with colour plates bringing to life the movement of soldiers on the battlefield.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

This book profiles dozens of outsider musicians, both prominent and obscure&#x2014;figures such as The Shaggs, Syd Barrett, Tiny Tim, Jandek, Captain Beefheart, Daniel Johnston, Harry Partch, and The Legendary Stardust Cowboy&#x2014;and presents their strange life stories along with photographs, interviews, cartoons, and discographies. About the only things these self-taught artists have in common are an utter lack of conventional tunefulness and an overabundance of earnestness and passion.

Thankfully, for every manufactured boy band and lip-synching pin-up there are 10 "outsiders"--the earnest, often psychotic and not necessarily ingenious stars in Chusid's enchanting universe. For those who've been bemoaning the shortage of ingenuity on the airwaves, Chusid, a radio personality on WFMU in Hoboken, N.J., profiles 20 darlings of dissonance. Several of them--including Tiny Tim, Captain Beefheart and Pink Floyd's former acid troubadour Syd Barrett--have made a few bangs, but the great majority have enjoyed mere whimpers of success. Take Eilert Pilarm, the Swedish Elvis; Joe Meek, who produced the 1962 instrumental hit "Telstar" before committing suicide; and the Shaggs, three sheltered sisters from Fremont, N.H., who recorded the "aboriginal rock" masterpiece Philosophy of the World. Careful not to ridicule his more eccentrically volatile subjects (e.g., Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston), Chusid narrates each musician's vital statistics and career with rhythm and respectful wit. Even if readers do not rush out to buy Larry "Wild Man" Fischer's recordings, they will remember his musical achievements (he inspired Frank Zappa's record An Evening with Wild Man Fischer), thanks to Chusid's encyclopedic tags. History, as the director Tony Philputt points out in the introduction, is also made by losers; Chusid has given them a microphone and cranked the amp to 11. 60 b&amp;w photos, 15 line drawings, discography. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Giving Quilt: An Elm Creek Quilts Novel</h2><p>Every stitch makes a difference in <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini&#x2019;s artful, inspiring novel that imagines what good would come from practicing the holiday spirit each and every day of the year. <br><br>At Elm Creek Manor, the week after Thanksgiving is &#x201c;Quiltsgiving,&#x201d; a time to commence a season of generosity. From near and far, quilters and aspiring quilters&#x2014;a librarian, a teacher, a college student, and a quilt-shop clerk among them&#x2014;gather for a special winter session of quilt camp, to make quilts for Project Linus, a charitable organization dedicated to providing handmade quilts and blankets to children in need. Each quilter, ever mindful that many of her neighbors, friends, and family members are struggling through difficult times, pledges the strength of her creative gifts to alleviate their collective burden. So it happens that when the Quiltsgiving participants swap fabrics and trade techniques around the quilting circle, the warm, bright, beautiful quilts they piece are infused with love and comfort. So, too, are their personal stories, which collectively consider the strength of human connection and its rich rewards.</p><p><b>Jennifer Chiaverini&nbsp;</b>is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, as well as five collections of quilt projects inspired by the novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker </i>is her most recent book<i>. &nbsp;</i>A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and The University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin.Chiaverini delivers another satisfying Elm Creek Quilst story in the latest title in this excellent series. &#x201c;Quiltsgiving,&#x201d; held after Thanksgiving for Elm Creek campers, is tied this year to Project Linus, the organization that makes blankets for critically ill children. Updates on the recurring characters, including Sarah and Sylvia, are present but take a backseat to the engrossing stories of six women attending the retreat. A young woman uses the camp for a college service project while recovering from a leg injury. A librarian camper recounts her fight to keep her branch open amid censorship and budget cuts. Others deal with loss, including one woman who missed out on a job at Elm Creek. This volume features the series at its best, with warm, fully realized characters and powerful themes. The Project Linus and quilting details provide a nice overlay but do not overpower the story, making it enjoyable even for nonquilters.

This abridged one-volume edition follows the structure of the two-volume edition, eliminating only the footnotes and some of the detail. It is a comprehensive history of the relations between the U.S. government and the Indians. Covering the two centuries from the Revolutionary War to 1980, the book traces the development of American Indian policy and the growth of the bureaucracy created to implement that policy.</p><p>&#39;The author&#39;s detailed analysis of two centuries of federal policy makes The Great Father indispensable reading for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of American Indian policy.&#39; - Journal of American History.Francis Paul Prucha, S.J., a leading authority on American Indian policy and the author of more than a dozen other books, is an emeritus professor of history at Marquette University.</p><h2>My Name Is Blessing</h2><p>&nbsp;Based on the life of a real boy, this warm-hearted, beautifully illustrated book tells the story of Baraka, a young Kenyan boy with a physical disability. Baraka and eight cousins live with their grandmother. She gives them boundless love, but there is never enough money or food, and life is hard --love doesn't feed hungry stomachs or clothe growing bodies, or school keen minds. Baraka is too young, and, with his disability, needs too much, and she is too old. A difficult choice must be made, and grandmother and grandchild set off on a journey to see if there is a place at the orphanage for Baraka. The story begins by looking at Baraka's physical disability as a misfortune, but ends by looking beyond the disability, to his great heart and spirit, and the blessings he brings.</p><p>A former social worker and elementary school teacher, Eric Walters wrote his first novel, <i>Stand Your Ground</i>, in 1993, as a way to get his grade five class of reluctant readers more interested in literature and writing. He did that by creating a novel about them - and it worked! Since then he has written more than 70 books for young adults that together have won more than 100 awards. In conjunction with his writing, Eric talks to hundreds of young people in schools and libraries across the country each year. Eric Walters also founded and runs The Creation of Hope, an organization dedicated to providing care for orphans in the rural Mbooni district in Kenya. Eric has three grown children. He lives with his wife in Mississauga, Ontario.<br><br>Award-winning illustrator Eugenie Fernandes has written and illustrated more than 20 of her own books, and has created the art for more 60 other picture books.

The whole Fernandes family has a flair for the creative: Eugenie's husband and their two children are also artists. Eugenie lives with her husband beside a lake near Peterborough, Ontario.&#x201c;This expressive picture book, based on a real family, lovingly tells a hard story with a twist. It&#x2019;s difficult to broach poverty, disability and custody issues in so few pages without sounding maudlin, but Walters manages by speaking simply. . . .

Re-released for the first time in 2018, Bed &amp; Board is Capon&#x2019;s enduring, rambunctious counsel on marriage and family life&#x2014;woven through with the message of grace that never changes.<br><br>From inside:<br><br>&#x201c;This book is not about those giants who tower over you: Psychology, Education, Maturity, Sexual Adjustment&#x2014;not even Religion. They can take care of themselves. This is about you&#x2014;that is, about me (for we are all unique, and practically identical). This is, to be honest, not a book at all. It is only a monologue, and not an entirely sober one at that. It is one peasant swapping stories with another in the cold backyard of the House of Important Subjects, while the grand seigneurs hold their solemn consultations within. The author&#x2019;s qualifications therefore almost cease to matter. Indeed, he has arranged things so that only one is really necessary: He must be an expert in absurdity.

Among the book's interesting revelations is Mandela's ambivalence toward his lifetime of devotion to public works. It cost him two marriages and kept him distant from a family life he might otherwise have cherished. <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i> also discloses a strong and generous spirit that refused to be broken under the most trying circumstances--a spirit in which just about everybody can find something to admire.Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa&#39;s anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account of the unforgettable events since his release that produced at last a free, multiracial democracy in South Africa. To millions of people around the world, Nelson Mandela stands, as no other living figure does, for the triumph of dignity and hope over despair and hatred, of self-discipline and love over persecution and evil.</p><h2>New York in Color</h2><p>This photographic portrait of New York captures the city as never before, in a vibrant visual tour, color by color.

Her father, the eccentric Lord Berrybender, is planning to head for Texas with his whole family and his retainers, English, American, and Native American. Tasmin, who would once have followed her husband, Jim Snow, anywhere, is no longer even sure she likes him, or knows where to go to next. Neither does anyone else&#x2014;even Captain Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame, is puzzled by the great changes sweeping over the West, replacing red men and buffalo with towns and farms.<br> <br>In the meantime, Jim Snow, accompanied by Kit Carson, journeys to New Orleans, where he meets up with a muscular black giant named Juppy, who turns out to be one of Lord Berrybender&#x2019;s many illegitimate offspring, and in whose company they make their way back to Santa Fe. But even they are unable to prevent the Mexicans from carrying the Berrybender family on a long and terrible journey across the desert to Vera Cruz.<br> <br>Starving, dying of thirst, and in constant, bloody battle with slavers pursuing them, the Berrybenders finally make their way to civilization&#x2014;if New Orleans of the time can be called that&#x2014;where Jim Snow has to choose between Tasmin and the great American plains, on which he has lived all his life in freedom, and where, after all her adventures, Tasmin must finally decide where her future lies.<br> <br>With a cast of characters that includes almost every major real-life figure of the West, <i>Folly and Glory</i> is a novel that represents the culmination of a great and unique four-volume saga of the early days of the West; it is one of Larry McMurtry&#x2019;s finest achievements.</p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.The fourth and final novel in Larry McMurtry's Berrybender Narratives features Lord Berrybender and his brood as they are arrested by Mexican authorities and forced to march across the desert to Vera Cruz, escorted by inept Mexican soldiers. Eventually, the family ends up in New Orleans, where they face some difficult decisions. McMurtry, who also wrote LONESOME DOVE, ties up the saga's loose ends in an entertaining way. Actor Alfred Molina's direct yet wry style fits this Western story wonderfully. In addition, Molina's ability to take on various voices adds to the presentation, making this a great conclusion to the bestselling series.

London is on fire from the Blitz, and a young woman gardener named Gwen Davis flees from the burning city for the Devon countryside. She has volunteered for the Land Army, and is to be in charge of a group of young girls who will be trained to plant food crops on an old country estate where the gardens have fallen into ruin. Also on the estate, waiting to be posted, is a regiment of Canadian soldiers. For three months, the young women and men will form attachments, living in a temporary rural escape. No one will be more changed by the stay than Gwen. She will inspire the girls to restore the estate gardens, fall in love with a soldier, find her first deep friendship, and bring a lost garden, created for a great love, back to life. While doing so, she will finally come to know herself and a life worth living.</p></p><p><strong>Helen Humphreys</strong>, a poet and novelist, is the author of <em>The Lost Garden</em>, <em>Afterimage</em>, <em>Leaving Earth</em>, and <em>Coventry</em>. She lives in Kingston, Ontario.Evocative, if occasionally clunky, Humphreys's third novel (following Afterimage) is the story of an Englishwoman's search for her place in a world permeated by war. The narrator, 35-year-old Gwen Davis, is a horticulturist who flees bombed-out WWII London to manage a team of "land girls"-women who grow vegetables as part of the war effort-at a country estate. She struggles to manage her wayward charges, who are more interested in the Canadian soldiers billeted in the main house than in cultivating potatoes, and writes letters in her head to her idol Virginia Woolf, whose recent death has left her feeling bereft. She also tries to seduce the world-weary, hard-drinking Captain Raley, who has a secret of his own that dooms their relationship. Though her conflicts pale next to those of the soldiers waiting to be posted to battle and even those of her new friend, Jane, whose cousin is a casualty of war and whose fiance is missing in action, it is Gwen's quiet self-discovery that is at the center of the novel. Humphreys renders convincingly her first, fleeting experience of deep friendship and love. Unfortunately, the story is sometimes marred by overwrought or cloying prose, though Humphreys's language also has its moments of elegance (during the blitz, "houses become holes. Solids become spaces. Anything can disappear overnight"). Humphreys doesn't quite have the narrative energy of Pat Barker and Jane Gardam, but fans of those authors may enjoy this exploration of the impact of WWII on English life.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Holy Yoga: Exercise. for the Christian Body and Soul</h2><p>People often equate yoga with<br>Eastern religion, but Brooke Boon<br>sees it as an exercise style that<br>Christians can use to generate patience,<br>strength, and deeper worship.<br>Author and yoga instructor<br>Brooke Boon combines her passion<br>for Christianity with her commitment<br>to health to introduce yoga as<br>a physical and spiritual discipline<br>that strengthens the body and the<br>soul. Clear explanations and photographs<br>make yoga accessible for<br>any reader, and Brooke offers customized<br>routines for readers struggling<br>with specific issues, such as<br>weight loss and anxiety. Through it all Brooke uses scriptural<br>references to help reinforce the idea that by taking<br>care of our bodies we can also take care of our faith.</p><p>Brooke Boon lives in<br>Phoenix, Arizona.Evangelical Christians are not often very enthusiastic about yoga, dismissing it as irrelevant at best and Satanic at worst. But for Boon, an Arizona yoga teacher who is the founder of the Holy Yoga ministry, yoga is a worship tool to enhance her relationship with Christ. Although Boon's writing is primitive and breathless, with excessive use of italics and exclamation points, she offers some decent ideas and memorable spiritual quotes from the likes of Eugene Peterson, Lauren Winner and Richard Foster. Boon first outlines the theological reasons for yoga practice, likening it to ancient Christian disciplines like fasting. This section can seem defensive and apologetic at times, as Boon expends energy answering her evangelical critics. Part two briefly highlights yoga as a healthy lifestyle (e.g., it can improve circulation, relieve stress and maintain a healthy weight) and offers tips on incorporating yoga into a neophyte's regular routine. The final, longest section presents various postures, with black-and-white illustrations. However, the instructions are brief and vague enough that Christians who are new to yoga will definitely want to supplement their fledgling practice with more detailed, step-by-step information, such as that contained in traditional yoga books or Susan Bordenkicher's more thorough <i>Yoga for Christians</i>.
